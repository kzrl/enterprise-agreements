1.1

Technical matters

This Determination will be known as the Department of Home Affairs Workplace
Determination 2019.

Parties covered
1.2

This Determination covers:
(a)

the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs (the Department) on behalf of
the Commonwealth,

(b)

all Employees of the Department, with the exception of any Senior Executive
Service (SES) Employee,

(c)

the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU), and

(d)

the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers (AIMPE).

Commencement and nominal expiry date
1.3

This Determination commences from the day on which it is made by the Fair Work
Commission. The nominal expiry date of this Determination is 2 years after the date
of commencement.

Delegations
1.4

The Secretary may delegate any or all of their powers and functions under this
Determination, including this power of delegation, and may do so subject to
conditions.

Interaction with policies
1.5

The operation of this Determination is supported by policies, procedures and
guidelines. If there is any inconsistency between the policies, procedures and
guidelines and the terms of this Determination, the express terms of this
Determination will prevail.

1.6

Policies, procedures, and guidelines which support this Determination are not
incorporated into, and do not form part of, this Determination.

Introduction of new policies and changes to existing policies
1.7

Where the Secretary proposes to introduce a new policy, procedure or guideline or
vary an existing policy, procedure or guideline they will provide Employees no
less than 2 weeks to comment on the proposed new or varied policy, procedure or
guideline. The Secretary must give genuine consideration to the comments made
by Employees prior to finalising the policy, procedure or guideline.

Interaction with industrial instruments and the NES
1.8

This is a comprehensive Determination that wholly replaces all awards and
enterprise agreements that would otherwise apply.

8

AG501682 PR704687

1.9

The terms of this Determination are intended to apply in a manner that does not
derogate from the NES. The NES will continue to apply to the extent that any term
of this Determination is detrimental to an Employee or the Secretary in any
respect when compared with the NES.

9

AG501682 PR704682

Part 2.

Remuneration

Salary
2.1

The salary rates for all classifications are set out at Attachment B of this
Determination.

2.2

Employees will receive salary increases of:
(a)

4 per cent with effect from 8 June 2018; and

(b)

3 per cent 12 months after commencement of the Determination.

2.3

Where application of the increases at clause 2.2 would result in the Employee’s rate
of salary exceeding the maximum salary applying to the Employee’s classification,
the Employee’s salary will be adjusted up to the maximum of the salary range, but
no higher.

2.4

For Legal and Public Affairs Officers, where an Employee’s current salary aligns
with one of the salary points set out at Attachment B of this Determination for their
classification they will translate to that pay point in the relevant APS broadband
classification. However, where the Employee’s current salary does not align with
any of the salary points set out at Attachment B of this Determination for their
classification they will translate at the salary point immediately above their current
salary.

Payment
2.5

An Employee will be paid fortnightly in arrears by electronic funds transfer into a
financial institution account of the Employee’s choice.

2.6

The fortnightly rate of pay is calculated using the following formula:
Annual rate of pay multiplied by 12 and divided by 313.

Salary on engagement, movement or promotion
2.7

10

Where an Employee is engaged by the Department or moves from another APS
agency to the Department they will be paid at:
(a)

the minimum of the salary range of the relevant classification; or

(b)

a higher salary, where determined by the Secretary.

2.8

On promotion, an Employee’s salary will normally be payable at the minimum of the
salary range attached to the higher classification. Where the Employee’s salary prior
to promotion was within 4 per cent of the minimum of the new classification the
Employee’s salary on promotion will be increased by a minimum of 4 per cent.

2.9

Employees who are promoted within the Department and, in the preceding 12
months, have undertaken higher duties at the level to which they are promoted will,
upon promotion, be paid a salary equivalent to the salary they were being paid on
higher duties.

AG501682 PR704687

Salary advancement
2.10

Employees will be eligible for annual salary advancement, within the pay range
applicable to their substantive classification, if the Employee:
(a)

has performed duties in the Department at or above their substantive
classification for a total of at least 6 months in the previous 12 months; and

(b)

in respect of that performance has received a rating of ‘met expectations’ or
above through participation in the Department’s performance assessment
process; and

(c)

is not a Casual employee or employed in a training classification.

2.11

For all Employees other than Legal Officers, Public Affairs Officers and Medical
Officers, advancement under clause 2.10 will be by an amount equal to 3 per cent of
the Employee’s substantive base salary. Where advancement under this clause would
result in the Employee’s base salary exceeding the maximum salary applying to the
Employee’s current substantive classification level as set out in the General salary
table in Attachment B, the Employee’s salary will be adjusted up to the maximum
of the salary range, but no higher.

2.12

For Legal Officers, Public Affairs Officers and Medical Officers, salary
advancement under clause 2.10 will be to the next salary point within the relevant
APS broadband classification set out in the applicable table in Attachment B.

2.13

Eligible Employees will receive their annual salary advancement on the first pay
cycle after 1 October each year provided that no less than 12 months has elapsed
since the last performance based salary advancement under this or a previous
instrument.

2.14

In recognition of the change made in this Determination to the date on which eligible
Employees will receive their annual salary advancement from 1 July to 1 October
under the terms of this Determination, those Employees who are eligible for salary
advancement on 1 October 2019 will receive a one-off taxable payment of $600.

Salary on reduction
2.15

Where an Employee agrees in writing to be reduced in classification, the Secretary
will determine a salary for the Employee at a rate applicable to the lower
classification level.

2.16

Where in accordance with section 23(4) of the Public Service Act 1999 an Employee
is reduced in classification without their consent, the Secretary will determine a
salary for the Employee at a rate applicable to the lower classification level.

Supported salary rates
2.17

Supported wage rates as set out in Schedule C of the Australian Public Service
Enterprise Award 2015 (as amended from time to time) will apply to an Employee
with a disability who is eligible for consideration under the Supported Wage
System.

11

AG501682 PR704682

Superannuation
2.18

The Secretary will make compulsory employer contributions as required by the
applicable legislation and fund requirements.

2.19

Where employer contributions are to the default accumulation superannuation fund
(PSSap), the employer contribution will be 15.4 per cent of the fortnightly
contribution salary (or ordinary time earnings where an Employee has exercised
fund choice). Employer contributions for Employees in other accumulation schemes
will be at the same rate as the default fund. This will not be reduced by any other
contributions made through salary sacrifice arrangements. This clause does not
apply where a superannuation fund cannot accept employer superannuation
contributions.

2.20

Employer superannuation contributions will not be paid on behalf of Employees
during a period of unpaid leave that does not count for service with the exception of
maternity, adoption/foster or supporting partner leave for a period equal to a
maximum of 52 weeks, unless prescribed by legislation.

2.21

The Secretary may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying
superannuation funds which allow employee and/or employer contributions to be
paid through fortnightly electronic funds transfer using a file generated by the
Department’s payroll system.

Recovery of overpayments

12

2.22

An overpayment occurs if the Secretary (or the Department) provides an Employee
with an amount of money to which the Employee was not entitled (including but not
limited to salary, entitlements, allowances, travel payment and/or other amount
payable under this Determination).

2.23

Where the Secretary considers that an overpayment has occurred, the Secretary will
provide the Employee with notice in writing. The notice will provide details of the
overpayment.

2.24

Where an Employee seeks to dispute the amount of the overpayment, they will
advise the Secretary in writing within 28 calendar days of receiving the notice. In
this event, no further action will be taken until the Employee’s response has been
reviewed.

2.25

If verified, the overpayment will be treated as a debt to the Commonwealth that
must be repaid to the Department in full by the Employee.

2.26

The Secretary and the Employee will discuss a suitable recovery arrangement. A
recovery arrangement will take into account the nature and amount of the debt, the
Employee’s financial circumstances and any potential hardship to the Employee.

2.27

Any overpayment outstanding on cessation of employment with the Department will
be deducted to the maximum extent possible from the Employee’s final pay
(including from outstanding entitlements paid at cessation).

2.28

Nothing in the preceding clauses prevents:

AG501682 PR704687

(a)

the Department from pursuing recovery of the debt in accordance with an
Accountable Authority Instruction issued under the Public Governance,
Performance and Accountability Act 2013;

(b)

the Department from pursuing recovery of the debt through other available
legal avenues; or

(c)

the Employee or the Department from seeking approval to waive the debt
under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.

Salary packaging
2.29

The Secretary will provide Employees with the option to salary package certain
benefits.

Individual flexibility arrangements
2.30

The Secretary and an Employee covered by this Determination may agree to make
an individual flexibility arrangement to vary the effect of terms of the Determination
if:
(a)

the arrangement deals with one or more of the following matters:
(i)

arrangements about when work is performed,

(ii)

overtime rates,

(iii) penalty rates,

2.31

2.32

(iv)

allowances,

(v)

leave loading; and

(b)

the arrangement meets the genuine needs of the Department and Employee in
relation to one or more of the matters mentioned in paragraph (a); and

(c)

the arrangement is genuinely agreed to by the Secretary and Employee.

The Secretary must ensure that the terms of the individual flexibility arrangement:
(a)

are about permitted matters under section 172 of the Fair Work Act 2009;

(b)

are not unlawful terms under section 194 of the Fair Work Act 2009; and

(c)

result in the Employee being better off overall than the Employee would be if
no arrangement was made.

The Secretary must ensure that the individual flexibility arrangement:
(a)

is in writing;

(b)

includes the name of the Secretary and Employee;

(c)

is signed by the Secretary and Employee and if the Employee is under 18 years
of age, signed by a parent or guardian of the Employee; and

13

AG501682 PR704682

(d)

includes details of:
(i)

the terms of the Determination that will be varied by the arrangement,

(ii)

how the arrangement will vary the effect of the terms,

(iii) how the Employee will be better off overall in relation to the terms and
conditions of his or her employment as a result of the arrangement; and
(e)

states the day on which the arrangement commences.

2.33

The Secretary must give the Employee a copy of the individual flexibility
arrangement within 14 days after it is agreed to.

2.34

The Secretary or Employee may terminate the individual flexibility arrangement:
(a)

by giving no more than 28 days written notice to the other party to the
arrangement; or

(b)

if the Secretary and Employee agree in writing – at any time.

Death of an employee
2.35

14

Where an Employee dies, or the Secretary has directed that an Employee will be
presumed to have died on a particular date, any outstanding amounts, and any
amounts that would have been payable to the Employee under this Determination
had the employee otherwise ceased employment, will be made to the Dependants,
Partner or the legal personal representative of the Employee.

AG501682 PR704687

Part 3.

Working hours and arrangements

Types of employment
Full-time employees
3.1

For Full-time employees, a standard working week is 37 hours and 30 minutes. The
standard working day is 7 hours and 30 minutes.

Part-time employees
3.2

Part-time employees work an agreed number of hours that is less than the standard
weekly hours.

3.3

Salary for Part-time employees will be calculated on a pro-rata basis according to
the proportion of standard weekly hours worked.

3.4

Leave, allowances and other entitlements under this Determination will apply to a
Part-time employee on a pro-rata basis according to the proportion of standard
weekly hours worked.

3.5

Part-time employees are entitled to Expense-related allowances as specified in this
Determination.

3.6

Where a Full-time employee is permitted to work part-time for personal reasons that
Employee will have a right to revert to their full-time employment at the level that
the Employee occupied prior to entering into the part-time work arrangement after
the Employee notifies the Secretary of their intention to return to full-time work.

Casual employees
3.7

Casual employees are not entitled to paid leave entitlements (other than long service
leave), notice of termination of employment, redundancy benefits and payment for
public holidays not worked. Casual employees will receive a loading of 20 per cent of
base salary in lieu of these entitlements.

3.8

Casual employees will accrue long service leave in accordance with the Long Service
Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.

Hours of duty
3.9

3.10

The standard hours of duty are:
(a)

08:30 hrs to 12:30 hrs and 13:30 hrs to 17:00 hrs, Monday to Friday, or

Northern Territory.

The Secretary may determine alternative standard hours of duty for an Employee or
group of Employees to meet the operational requirements of the Department. Where
the Secretary is proposing to determine alternative standard hours of duty for an
Employee or group of Employees the Secretary will consult with relevant Employees
and their representatives, if any, in accordance with Part 7 of this Determination.
15

AG501682 PR704682

3.11

Employees may be required to work reasonable additional hours (including
overtime).

3.12

Employees will record their times of attendance in a manner determined by the
Secretary.

3.13

Employees will not be required to work more than 5 consecutive hours without an
unpaid meal break of at least 30 minutes, unless in exceptional circumstances.

Part-time employees and leave balances
3.14

For a two month period from the commencement of this Determination, Employees
who immediately prior to the commencement of this Determination worked a part
time arrangement based on a standard working week of 36 hours and 45 minutes will
have an opportunity to elect in writing to increase their working hours by at least
2.04 per cent. Where such an election is made, all accrued leave balances (other than
long service leave) will be grossed up by 2.04 per cent.

Unauthorised absence
3.15

Where an Employee is absent from the workplace without the approval of the
Secretary, all pay and entitlements provided for under this Determination cease to
apply until the Employee resumes duty or is granted leave.

Flexible working arrangements
Flex-time

16

3.16

Flex-time is a system of flexible working hours which enables Employees and the
Secretary to vary working hours, patterns and arrangements to provide maximum
organisational flexibility that benefits Employees and the Department.

3.17

Unless otherwise determined by the Secretary, flex-time is available to all APS Level
1-6 Employees, other than Casual employees, those working shift work, those
employed at overseas posts or those required to work standard hours.

3.18

Flex-time arrangements are subject to approval by the Secretary. Approval is
conditional on operational requirements being met and an efficient service
continuing to be provided to the public. Where the Secretary is proposing to
withdraw approval for flex-time arrangements for operational reasons (including
service delivery) for a work area or group of Employees, the Secretary will consult
with relevant Employees and their representatives, if any, in accordance with Part 7
of this Determination.

3.19

Employees may use flex-time to vary their standard hours of duty on an irregular
basis or for absences in lieu of other leave types.

3.20

Where there is insufficient work, the Secretary may require an Employee to work
their standard hours.

AG501682 PR704687

Flex-time bandwidth
3.21

Flex-time is worked within a bandwidth of 07:00 hrs to 19:00 hrs, Monday to Friday
except for in the Northern Territory where flex-time is worked within the bandwidth
of 06:30 hrs to 18:30 hrs, Monday to Friday.

Settlement period
3.22

The ordinary working days over which calculations are made to determine flex credit
or flex debit (the ‘settlement period’) will be 4 weeks.

Maximum credit
3.23

At the end of a settlement period, the maximum flex credit carried over is the
equivalent of the standard weekly working hours for the Employee, or the average
weekly hours for Part-time employees.

3.24

If there are operational pressures, the Secretary may approve a higher flex credit
carry over on a temporary basis.

Maximum debit
3.25

At the end of a settlement period, the maximum flex debit is 10 hours, or 5 hours
where an Employee works less than 25 hours per week.

3.26

Where an Employee has a flex debit that exceeds the maximum allowable at clause
3.25 the excess must be reduced by the end of the next settlement period unless
otherwise agreed between the Secretary and the Employee.

Flex-time at cessation of employment
3.27

Prior to cessation of employment with the Department, Employees must take all
reasonable steps to balance their flex credits or debits. The Secretary should provide
opportunities to enable Employees to balance any flex debits or credits.

3.28

Where the Secretary agrees that it was not possible to balance flex credits due to
operational requirements, the Employee’s flex credit, up to the maximum flex credit
carry over for a settlement period, will be paid out on separation from the
Department.

3.29

Where an Employee ceases employment with the Department with a flex debit, they
may choose to acquit the debit with annual leave credits. Otherwise, the Secretary is
authorised to recover debits from the Employee’s salary or final pay.

Withdrawal of flex-time
3.30

The Secretary may require an Employee to work standard hours for a period where
the Secretary has concerns that the Employee is misusing flex-time.

17

AG501682 PR704682

Time off for Executive Level Employees
3.31

The Secretary may grant Executive Level Employees time off in recognition of
additional hours worked. Time off is not expected to recompense for additional hours
on a one-for-one basis and cannot be cashed out.

3.32

The Secretary may grant Executive Level Employees time off to allow for variations
in attendance times and short term absences.

Requests for flexible working arrangements under the Fair Work Act
3.33

An Employee may request a change in working arrangements in accordance with
Division 4, Part 2-2 of the Fair Work Act 2009. Where an employee makes such a
request, the Secretary may refuse the request only on reasonable business grounds
and will provide the Employee with a written response within 21 days stating
whether the request has been granted or refused.

Home-based work
3.34

The Secretary may approve home-based work and teleworking arrangements, subject
to meeting security, work health and safety and operational requirements. The agreed
arrangements can only be varied by mutual consent and may be terminated by either
party with a minimum notice period of four weeks (or shorter if agreed).

practicable, within one month after the holiday. If a day of leave in lieu is not
practicable, one day of pay at ordinary rates will be paid. One day of pay in this case

behaviour by a Family member of an Employee that seeks to coerce or control the
Employee and that causes them harm or to be fearful.
‘Family member’ means:
(i) a Partner, De facto partner, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild or sibling of the

33

AG501682 PR704682

4.76

A reference to a Partner or De facto partner in the definition of Family member in
clause 4.74 includes a former Partner or De facto partner.

Entitlement to unpaid leave
4.77

An Employee is entitled to 5 days’ unpaid leave to deal with Family and domestic
violence, as follows:
(a) the leave is available in full at the start of each 12 month period of the
Employee’s employment, and
(b) the leave does not accumulate from year to year, and
is available in full to Part-time and Casual employees.
Notes:

1. A period of leave to deal with Family and domestic violence may be less
than a day by agreement between the Employee and the Secretary.
2. The Secretary and Employee may agree that the Employee may take
more than 5 days’ unpaid leave to deal with Family and domestic violence.

Taking unpaid leave
4.78

An Employee may take unpaid leave to deal with Family and domestic violence if
the Employee:
(a) is experiencing Family and domestic violence; and
(b) needs to do something to deal with the impact of the Family and domestic
violence and it is impractical for the Employee to do that thing outside their
ordinary hours of work.
Note: The reasons for which an Employee may take leave include making
arrangements for their safety or the safety of a Family member (including
relocation), attending urgent court hearings or accessing police services.

Service and continuity
4.79

The time an Employee is on unpaid leave to deal with Family and domestic violence
does not count as service but does not break the Employee’s continuity of service.

Notice and evidence requirements
4.80

An Employee must give their Manager notice of the taking of leave by the Employee
under clause 4.78. The notice:
(i) must be given to their Manager as soon as practicable (which may be a time after
the leave has started); and
(ii) must advise their Manager of the period, or expected period, of the leave.

34

AG501682 PR704687

4.81

An Employee who has given their Manager notice of the taking of leave under clause
4.78 must, if required by the Secretary, provide evidence that would satisfy a
reasonable person that the leave is taken for the purpose specified in clause 4.78.
Note: Depending on the circumstances such evidence may include a document issued
by the police service, a court or a family violence support service, or a statutory
declaration.

Confidentiality
4.82

The Secretary must take steps to ensure information concerning any notice an
Employee has given, or evidence an Employee has provided under clause 4.81 is
treated confidentially, as far as it is reasonably practicable to do so.

4.83

Nothing in clause 4.82 prevents the Secretary from disclosing information provided
by an Employee if the disclosure is required by an Australian law or is necessary to
protect the life, health or safety of the Employee or another person.
Note: Information concerning an Employee’s experience of Family and domestic
violence is sensitive and if mishandled can have adverse consequences for the
Employee. The Secretary should discuss with the Employee the handling of this
information.

Compliance
4.84

An Employee is not entitled to take leave under clause 4.78 unless the Employee
complies with clauses 4.80 and 4.81.

Portability of accrued leave
4.85

Where an Employee moves (including on promotion or for an agreed period) from
another Agency where they were an Ongoing employee or an ongoing employee of
the Parliamentary Service or the ACT Government Service, the Employee’s unused
accrued annual leave and personal/carer’s leave (however described) will be
recognised, provided there is no break in continuity of service.

4.86

Where the Secretary employs the Employee on an Ongoing basis, and immediately
prior to the engagement the person was employed as a Non-ongoing employee, the
Secretary may, at the Employee’s request, recognise any accrued annual leave and
personal/carer’s leave (however described), provided there is no break in continuity
of service.

4.87

Any recognised leave excludes any accrued leave paid out by the former Agency on
separation from that Agency.

35

AG501682 PR704682

Purchased leave
Purchased leave (44/52)
4.88

The Secretary may approve an application from an Employee to purchase up to 8
weeks of additional leave per year.

4.89

If an Employee does not use all or part of the purchased leave within 12 months
from application, the Employee will be re-funded the cost of the leave not taken at
the rate it was purchased, as a lump sum.

Sabbatical leave
4.90

Where an Ongoing employee has completed at least 2 years of continuous
employment with the Department, they may apply to the Secretary for access to
sabbatical leave.

4.91

This is a flexible arrangement consisting of a 4 year continuous work period
followed by a one year period of leave, with salary spread over the 5 years. An
Employee whose sabbatical leave application is approved receives one year’s
sabbatical leave by agreeing to forgo 20 per cent of their eligible salary on each
payday in each of the 4 years immediately prior to going on one year’s sabbatical
leave.

4.92

If an Employee does not use all or part of the sabbatical leave within a one year
period, the Employee will be refunded the cost of the leave not taken at the rate it
was purchased, as a lump sum.

4.93

The first 4 years will count as service for all purposes, and the fifth year will not
count as service for any purpose.

4.94

An Employee accessing sabbatical leave cannot also apply for purchased leave as
prescribed at clause 4.88 of this Determination.

Study leave and financial assistance

36

4.95

The Secretary may approve an application from an Ongoing employee (who has
successfully completed probation) for paid study leave of up to 7 hours and 30
minutes per week during each semester (including for exams) for approved courses
that are relevant to the Department’s operational requirements.

4.96

The Secretary may also approve an application for financial assistance for such
study. Ongoing employees are eligible for reimbursement of course fees up to $825
for the first approved subject in a semester and up to $590 for each additional
subject (with those amounts to be adjusted in line with the 3 per cent salary increase
12 months after the commencement of this Determination).

4.97

Employees undertaking Legal Workshop are eligible for total reimbursement of up
to $2,471 for course fees for the entire course of study. Where the Legal Workshop
is undertaken part-time, at the end of each semester an Employee is eligible to claim
$1,235.50 for course fees for units successfully completed that semester, subject to a
maximum reimbursement of $2,471 for the entire course of study (with those

AG501682 PR704687

amounts to be adjusted in line with the 3 per cent salary increase 12 months after the
commencement of this Determination).

War service sick leave
4.98

The Secretary will grant war service sick leave to Employees who are unfit for duty
because of a war-caused or defence-caused condition. A war-caused or defencecaused condition is an injury or disease that has been determined under the
Veterans’ Entitlement Act 1986 or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation
Act 2004 to be war-caused or defence-caused.

4.99

Employees who are eligible for war service sick leave will be granted:
(a) a 9 week special credit of war service sick leave from the date they commence
employment with the APS; and
(b) a 3 week annual credit of war service sick leave on the date of commencement
with the APS and after each subsequent 12 months of service. This may not be
granted until the special credit has expired.

4.100

Unused annual credits will accumulate, subject to a maximum annual credit balance
of 9 weeks.

Christmas/New Year period
4.101

The Secretary may direct that an Employee take leave between Christmas Day and
New Year’s Day (inclusive). Where the Secretary proposes to direct that an
Employee take leave between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day (inclusive), the
Secretary will provide the Employee with no less than one month’s notice of their
intention to do so.

4.102

Employees may access flex credits or accrued time off in lieu to cover this period in
the first instance. If the Employee is not able to use flex credits or accrued time off
in lieu, the Employee will access annual leave. If the Employee is not able to access
annual leave for the period, the Secretary must consider that there are reasonable
grounds for the direction in relation to that Employee. Reasonable grounds include,
but are not limited to, insufficient work or insufficient supervision in that period.

4.103

If an Employee has insufficient annual leave, flex credits or accrued time off in lieu,
unpaid miscellaneous leave will be granted for the period in accordance with clause
4.44.

For the purpose of the work location allowance:
(a) ‘Public transport’ means a system of buses, trains, etc, running on fixed routes,
of reasonable frequency, on which the public may travel. This transport may be
operated by public or private entities, however, the cost of such transport from
point to point must be broadly comparable with the cost of such travel elsewhere
within the same network or city to be considered as ‘public transport’ for the
purpose of this definition.
(b) ‘Public transport hub’ means a major transport junction in a locality where a
number of designated public transport routes meet and where it would be
reasonable to expect that an employee would be able to commute to irrespective
of their place of residence within that locality. Public transport hubs include but
are not limited to:

The amount of the allowance has been determined taking into account the following
components:
(a) lack of Public transport – payable where Public transport is unavailable as per
clause 5.40;
(b) economic impact on Employees – payable where Employees are impacted by (a)
and are also subject to additional costs at the work location, e.g. pay parking;
(c) social impact on Employees – payable where Employees are impacted by (a) and
the work location:
(i) has access to limited amenities and is more than 3km from a range of shops
and facilities; or
(ii) there is an imposition of further travel upon arrival (e.g. provided parking is a
distance away from the work site necessitating use of a further mode of
transport).

AG501682 PR704682

5.42

Employees who do not satisfy the ‘lack of Public transport’ component of the
allowance will not receive the ‘economic impact’ or ‘social impact’ components of

The scale for rating an Employee’s performance under the PMF is:
(a)

exceeded expectations;

(b)

met expectations; and

(c)

did not meet expectations.

If there is a disagreement over the performance expectations or the performance rating
determined by the Employee’s Manager, the matter may be referred to a PMF
Reviewer. If no PMF reviewer has previously been nominated, the Reviewer will be a
person agreed to by both the Employee and their Manager. If agreement on a
Reviewer cannot be reached, an independent person will be appointed by the
Secretary. Throughout the review process, the Reviewer, the Employee and their
Manager will continue to together work constructively towards resolution.

Performance Improvement Process
6.5.

Where an Employee’s performance (other than a Casual employee or an Employee on
probation) is likely to be or has been assessed as ‘did not meet expectations’, a
performance improvement process will be initiated. The aim of the performance
improvement process is to assist the Employee achieve the expected standard of
performance.

6.6.

The performance improvement process must allow for procedural fairness and ensure
that the Employee:
(a)

50

understands the standard of performance that is expected of them;

AG501682 PR704687

6.7.

(b)

understands the implications of not achieving that standard; and

(c)

is provided with appropriate support and time to improve performance.

The performance improvement process can commence at any time during the
performance management cycle where an Employee’s performance is considered as
needing improvement. The process involves two steps – the first involving informal
discussions and the second, if needed, a formal assessment period.

Step 1 – Initial discussions
6.8.

Where a performance improvement process is triggered under clause 6.5, in the first
instance discussions involving the Employee and their Manager will occur in an
attempt to address the performance issues. Those discussions should be documented
and identify any mitigating factors which may be impacting on the Employee’s
performance, e.g. issues of a personal nature.

6.9.

This step will be 4 weeks in duration and may, in exceptional circumstances, be
extended by the Secretary.

Step 2 – Assessment period
6.10. The Assessment Period may be initiated by the Secretary where the initial discussions
at Step 1 above have not resulted in the Employee’s performance returning to the
expected standard.
6.11. Where an Assessment Period has been initiated, the Employee will be issued with a
formal warning. Further, the Secretary will appoint an assessor who is a senior
employee from outside of the Employee’s work area to:
(a) establish a Performance Improvement Plan in consultation with the Employee;
(b) monitor the Employee’s performance; and
(c) provide the Secretary with a written report at the end of the Assessment Period on
whether the Employee attained and sustained an acceptable standard of work
performance.
6.12. The Assessment Period will be 8 weeks in duration and may, in exceptional
circumstances, be extended by the Secretary.
6.13. If at the end of the Assessment Period the Employee has attained and sustained the
expected standard of work performance, no further action will be taken.
6.14. However, if at the end of the Assessment Period the Employee has not attained and
sustained the expected standard of work performance, the Secretary will determine
what, if any, action should appropriately be taken. The appropriate action may include
terminating the Employee’s employment.

Part 8.

Redeployment and redundancy

Eligibility
8.1

This Part applies to Ongoing employees who are not on probation.

8.2

An Employee is excess to the Department’s requirements where:
(a)

the Employee is included in a class of Employees, which class comprises a
greater number of Employees than is necessary for the efficient and
economical working of the Department;

(b)

the Employee’s services cannot be effectively used because of technological or
other changes in the work methods of the Department or changes in the nature,
extent or organisation of the functions of the Department; or

(c)

the Employee’s duties have been transferred to another Location to which the
Employee is not willing to move and the Secretary determines that these
provisions will apply to the Employee.

Consultation process
8.3

Where the Department intends to declare Employees excess to its requirements, the
Secretary will consult with relevant Employees and their representatives, if any, in
accordance with Part 7 of this Determination.

8.4

Notwithstanding clause 8.3, where 15 or more Employees are to be declared excess,
the Department will consult with the relevant trade union(s) consistent with the
provisions of Subdivision B of Division 2 of Part 3-6 of the Fair Work Act 2009.

Redeployment
8.5

The Secretary will take all reasonable steps to redeploy an excess (or potentially
excess) Employee to a suitable position within the Department and, if no suitable
positions are available, within the wider APS through collaborative arrangements
with other agencies.

Voluntary redundancy

56

8.6

The Secretary may invite Employees to express interest in voluntary redundancy.
The recipients and procedures for such invitations will be determined by the
Secretary on a case-by-case basis.

8.7

An Employee will only be made one offer of voluntary redundancy.

8.8

An Employee offered voluntary redundancy, in any circumstance, will have one
month to consider the offer. Unless the Employee agrees, the Secretary will not issue
a notice of termination before the one-month consideration period has passed.

8.9

In the month prior to, or following, the offer of voluntary redundancy, an Employee
must be given information on the:

AG501682 PR704687

(a) amount of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice and paid up leave credits;
(b) amount of accumulated superannuation contributions;
(c) options open to the employee concerning superannuation; and
(d) taxation rules applying to the various payments.
8.10

The one month consideration period can be reduced by agreement between the
Secretary and the Employee where the Employee advises that they have been
provided with the advice detailed in the preceding clause. Where the period is
reduced, the Employee will be paid for the unexpired period of the consideration
period as at the date of termination and a payment in lieu of the relevant period of
notice specified in clause 8.12 below.

Financial advice
8.11

Employees who have been made an offer of voluntary redundancy will be provided
with assistance in seeking financial advice. Upon production of receipts that services
have been provided, the Department will reimburse the Employee for costs
associated with consultations with a qualified financial adviser of the Employee’s
choice up to a maximum of $640.

Period of notice of termination
8.12

Where an excess Employee’s employment is terminated, the period of notice will be
4 weeks. In the case of an Employee over 45 years of age with at least 5 years
continuous service the period of notice will be 5 weeks.

8.13

Where the Secretary directs, or the Employee requests, a termination date within the
notice period, the Employee’s employment will terminate on that date. In these
circumstances, the Employee will be paid a payment in lieu of notice for the
unexpired portion of the notice period. The payments an Employee would have
received in respect of the ordinary time the employee would have worked during the
period of notice, had the employment not been terminated, will be used in calculating
any payment in lieu of notice.

Redundancy pay
8.14

8.15

Unless the NES provides for a greater entitlement, an excess Employee whose
employment is voluntarily terminated will be entitled to a redundancy payment
comprising of:
(a)

a sum equal to 2 weeks’ salary for each completed year of continuous service;
and

(b)

a pro-rata payment for completed months of service since the last completed
year of service.

The minimum sum payable will be 4 weeks’ salary and the maximum will be 48
weeks’ salary.

57

AG501682 PR704682

8.16

The redundancy payment will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period where
an Employee has worked part-time hours during their period of service and the
Employee has less than 24 years of full-time service, subject to any minimum
amount the Employee is entitled to under the NES.

Service for redundancy pay purposes
8.17

Service for redundancy pay purposes means:
(a) service in the Department;
(b) Government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976;
(c) service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a Joint CommonwealthState body corporate in which the Commonwealth has a controlling interest)
which is recognised for long service leave purposes;
(d) service in the Australian Defence Forces;
(e) APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under the repealed
section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922, if the service has not previously been
recognised for severance pay purposes; or
(f) service in another organisation where:

8.18

i.

an Employee was transferred from the APS to that organisation with a
transfer of function, or

ii.

an Employee engaged by that organisation on work within a function is
appointed as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS, and

iii.

such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.

For earlier periods of service to count there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where:
(a) the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of
employment in relation to the second period of service was made and accepted by
the Employee before the first period of service ended (whether or not the 2
periods of service are with the same employer or Agency); or
(b) the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the Employee
was deemed to have resigned from the Department on marriage under the
repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922.

8.19

Any period of service which ceased:
(a) by way of termination under section 29 of the Public Service Act 1999, or
(b) prior to the commencement of the Public Service Act 1999 by way of
retrenchment, retirement on grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or loss of

58

AG501682 PR704687

qualifications, forfeiture of office, dismissal, termination of probationary
appointment for reasons of unsatisfactory service, or
(c) by voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the
Employee, or
(d) with the payment of an employer-financed retirement benefit,
will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes.
8.20

Absences from work which do not count as service for long service leave purposes
will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes.

Salary for redundancy pay purposes
8.21

For the purpose of calculating the redundancy payment, salary includes:
(a) the Employee’s salary at their classification level; or
(b) the salary at a higher classification level, where the Employee has been working
at the higher level on higher duties for a continuous period of at least 12 months
immediately preceding the date on which the Employee is given notice of
termination; and
(c) the allowances identified as salary for the purposes of redundancy in column 4 of
the table at clause 5.2 of this Determination.

Retention periods
8.22

Where an excess Employee has not accepted an offer of voluntary redundancy, the
Secretary will not terminate the Employee’s employment until the following
retention periods have elapsed:
(a) 13 months where an employee has 20 or more years of service or is over 45 years
of age; or
(b) 7 months for all other employees.

8.23

If, however, an Employee is entitled to a redundancy payment in accordance with the
NES, the relevant retention period specified above will be reduced by the number of
weeks redundancy pay that the Employee will be entitled to under the NES on
termination, as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this clause).
For example, an Employee who would otherwise be eligible for a retention period of
7 months and a NES redundancy payment equivalent to 12 weeks’ salary, will be
offered a retention period of seven months minus 12 weeks.

8.24

This retention period will commence on the earlier of the following:
(a) the day that the Employee is advised in writing by the Secretary that they are an
excess Employee; or

59

AG501682 PR704682

(b) one month after the day on which the Secretary invites the Employee to accept
voluntary redundancy
subject to reductions in the length of period to offset redundancy entitlements under
the NES, as described in the clause 8.23.
8.25

The retention period will be extended by any periods of certified personal leave taken
by the Employee for reasons of personal illness or injury during the retention period.
Any such extension will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the NES redundancy
entitlement.

8.26

During the retention period, the Secretary:
(a) will continue to take reasonable steps to find alternative employment for the
excess Employee; and
(b) may, on request, provide assistance in meeting reasonable travel costs and
incidental expenses incurred in seeking alternative employment; and
(c) may, with 4 weeks’ notice, assign the Employee to duties at a lower classification
as a means of securing alternative employment. Where this occurs before the end
of an Employee’s retention period, the Employee will receive income
maintenance to maintain their salary at the previous higher level for the balance
of the retention period.

8.27

During a retention period an Employee’s salary will be:
(a) the salary at their classification level; or
(b) the salary at a higher classification level, where the Employee has been working
at the higher level on higher duties for a continuous period of at least 12 months
immediately preceding the date on which the Employee was notified that they
were excess and that acting would have continued but for being declared excess;
and
(c) other allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of annual
leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement for
expenses incurred, or a payment for disabilities associated with the performance
of duty.

8.28

An excess Employee required to move their household to a new locality because of a
reassignment of duties, will be entitled to reasonable expenses subject to negotiation
with the Secretary.

8.29

Where there is insufficient productive work available for the excess Employee within
the Department during the remainder of the retention period and there are no
reasonable redeployment prospects in the APS, the Secretary may:
(a) with the agreement of the Employee, terminate the employee’s employment
under section 29 of the Public Service Act 1999; and

60

AG501682 PR704687

(b) upon termination, pay the balance of the retention period to the Employee as a
lump sum, with any such payment being reduced by an amount equivalent to the
Employee’s entitlement to redundancy pay under the NES. This payment will be
taken to include payment in lieu of notice of termination of employment. An
Employee whose employment is terminated in these circumstances will also be
entitled to a redundancy payment in accordance with their NES entitlement.
8.30

The Secretary may involuntarily terminate the employment of an excess Employee at
the end of the retention period.

8.31

An excess Employee will not have their employment terminated involuntarily if:
(a) they have not been offered voluntary redundancy; or
(b) if they have accepted voluntary redundancy and the Secretary has refused to
approve it.

8.32

An excess Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated will be given
notice of termination in accordance with clause 8.12 of this Determination. The
specified periods of notice will, as far as practicable, be concurrent with the retention
periods specified in clause 8.22 of this Determination.

Transitional arrangements
9.18

Where on commencement of this Determination an Employee was in receipt of
remote locality conditions for a Location which is no longer designated a remote
locality as a result of the operation of clause 9.6 of this Determination, the level of
remote locality conditions being provided to the Employee at the commencement of
this Determination will continue to apply but will reduce by 25 per cent each 6
months after commencement of this Determination until such time as the level of
remote locality conditions is reduced to zero in respect of those locations which are

Determination.

Motor vehicle allowance

the Secretary is satisfied that these costs were reasonably incurred.

Rest periods
9.28

If an Employee:
(a)

undertakes a journey in the course of the performance of their duties, and

9.34

An Employee will not receive reimbursement for excess fares if they are receiving
travel allowance or if they have been advised in writing that they will be permanently
relocated to another Location within the city or town where they currently work.
