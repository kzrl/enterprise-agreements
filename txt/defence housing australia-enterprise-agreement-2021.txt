employee.

12. Salary advancement

contribution salary as that required for employees who are members of
PSSap which will be no less than 15.4 per cent. This will not be reduced

Defence Housing Australia Enterprise Agreement 2021

(a)

joint responsibility – employees and managers will participate in
all aspects of the performance management process, including
initiating reviews, and seeking and providing feedback as
required.

(b)

no surprises – the performance process will ensure that
employees are aware of their performance progress. Managers
should identify and address performance concerns at the earliest

fair – the performance process will provide employees with an
opportunity to respond to performance feedback, consistent with
natural justice principles.

The provisions of Part D do not apply to employees during their first six
(6) months of employment in the APS.

level, an underperformance process may be initiated. Further
information is in DHA’s guidelines for managing underperformance.

level required at the employee’s classification level, the Managing
Director may:

The maximum credit a full time employee may accrue is 37 hours and
30 minutes.

28.10

The maximum credit a part time employee can accrue is the agreed
hours to be worked over a four (4) week period, divided by four (4).

28.11

The maximum debit a full time or part time employee may accrue is
10 hours. Any debit that would take the employee beyond 10 hours debit
will be treated as unpaid leave and may be regarded as an unauthorised
absence.

28.12

Employees who work according to a roster (including shiftworkers) will
have their rosters include sufficient additional time each day for full time
employees at DHA6 level and below to allow such employees to take a
flex day each four (4) weeks. The flex day will then be included in the
roster.

28.13

An employee who works according to a roster may work in excess of the
roster with the approval of the relevant manager. Where this is the case,
the employee will accrue a credit for the additional time other than where
the additional time is approved overtime.

28.14

Where a DHA level 6 or below employee is temporarily reassigned for
more than three (3) months or promoted to an Executive level role, the
manager and the employee should take all reasonable steps to balance
any flex credits or debits to zero.

28.15

An employee will not be paid for any credits held by the employee on
cessation of employment with DHA. Managers and employees have a
joint obligation to reduce flex credits to zero prior to the employee
ceasing employment.

28.16

The value of any debits held by the employee on cessation of
employment will be treated as an overpayment and must be repaid. This
repayment will normally be by way of a reduction in the employee’s final
payment. Further information can be found in DHA’s Accountable
Authority Instructions.

shiftworker.

30.4

The Managing Director will not generally change a shift roster with less

that are available to it under the Fair Work Act 2009. A decision that the Fair

test for a Disability Support Pension.

When an employee’s assessed capacity is 10 per cent, a higher degree of

schedule must be documented in a Supported Wage System wage
assessment agreement, and retained by the employer as a time and wage
record in accordance with the Act.

Assessment of capacity

an employee, the productive capacity of the employee will be assessed in
accordance with the System and documented in the assessment
instrument.

Lodgement of assessment instrument

assessment. All assessment instruments, including the appropriate
percentage of the salary to be paid to the employee, will be lodged by the
employer with the Fair Work Commission.

Review of assessment

The assessment of the applicable percentage should be subject to annual
review or earlier, on the basis of a reasonable request for a review. The
process of review will be in accordance with the procedures for assessing
capacity under the System.

Other terms and conditions of employment

Where an assessment has been made, the applicable percentage will
apply to salary only. Employees covered by the provisions of the System
will be entitled to the same terms and conditions of employment as all other
workers covered by the Agreement, paid on a pro rata basis.

Workplace adjustment

DHA will take reasonable steps to enhance the employee’s capacity to

In order for an adequate assessment of the employee’s capacity to be
made, an employer may employ a person under the provisions of the
System for a trial period not exceeding twelve weeks, except that in some
cases additional work adjustment time (not exceeding four (4) weeks) may
be needed.

4.12

During that trial period the assessment of capacity will be undertaken and
the percentage of the relevant minimum wage for a continuing employment
relationship will be determined. The minimum amount payable to the
employee during the trial period will be not less than the minimum amount
determined by the Annual Wage Review by the Fair Work Commission.

4.13

Work trials should include induction or training as appropriate to the job
being trialled.

Undertaking - Section 190
I, Barry Jackson, Managing Director have the authority given to me by Defence Housing
Australia to give the following undertakings with respect to the Defence Housing Australia
Enterprise Agreement 2021 ("the Agreement"):
1. Defence Housing Australia (DHA) undertakes that where an employee is engaged as
either a Cadet or a Graduate, the employee will be classified as a Broadband 2.
2. Any broadbanded classifications created in accordance with clause 20.3, will only be formed
by banding together existing classifications as identified in Appendix 1. Employees who fall
within a newly created broadbanded classification will not be assigned a classification lower than
their existing classification at the time the broadbanded classification was created. These
employees will be eligible for upward movement within the broadband in accordance with clause
20.2.
3. Where DHA requires an employee to work according to a roster which includes
ordinary hours falling between 6:30pm and 6:30am Monday to Friday, or from 6:00 pm to
6:30 am Monday to Friday if the employee is classified as a trainee, the employee will be entitled
to a shift penalty of 15 per cent.
4. Where DHA requires an employee to work a continuous night shift during Monday to
Friday, the employee will be entitled to a shift penalty of 30 per cent. A continuous night shift is
where the shifts fall wholly within the period 6:00pm and 8:00am and are worked for a period
exceeding four weeks.
5. DHA undertakes that where an employee is required to work overtime not continuous
with normal duty between 6:30pm and 6:30am Monday to Friday, the employee will
be entitled to overtime in accordance with the provisions of clauses 32.4 to 32.6 of the
Agreement.
These undertakings are provided on the basis of issues raised by the Fair Work Commission
in the application before the Fair Work Commission.
