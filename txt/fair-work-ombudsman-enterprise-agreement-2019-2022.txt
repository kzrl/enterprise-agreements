Relationship to other legislation
6.

This Agreement will be read and interpreted in conjunction with the National
Employment Standards (NES). Where there is an inconsistency between this
agreement and the NES, and the NES provides a greater benefit, the NES provision
will apply to the extent of the inconsistency.

7.

This agreement operates in conjunction with a range of other Acts (including

time to time, that may regulate terms and conditions of employment, including, but not

Supporting policies, procedures, guides and guidelines
8.

This agreement refers to various policies, procedures, guides and guidelines as in
force from time to time. To avoid doubt, any policies, procedures, guides and
guidelines referred to in this agreement are not incorporated into, and do not form part
of, this agreement. A term of this agreement prevails to the extent of any inconsistency
with a policy, procedure, guide or guideline.

Delegation
9.

Where the agreement implies that approval is necessary or specifies that payment will
be made or leave will be granted, but a head of power is not specified, the agreement
should be read as meaning the approval of the Fair Work Ombudsman will be obtained
prior to the action occurring.

10.

The Fair Work Ombudsman may delegate any or all of his or her powers or functions
under this agreement, including this power of delegation, and may do so subject to
conditions.

Part B - Forms of employment
Full-time employees
11.

Full-time employees will be engaged on the basis that their ordinary hours of work will
be equivalent to 150 hours per four week period.

12.

Full-time employees will be paid fortnightly, in arrears, based on the following formula:

Fortnightly pay =

annual salary x 12
313

Part-time employees
13.

Part-time employees will be engaged on the basis that their ordinary hours of work are
less than 150 hours per four week period. Employees are required to work at least
three hours on any agreed working day, unless otherwise agreed between the
employee and their manager.

14.

Where the hours of a part-time employee are to be varied for a short period, flextime or
other flexible working arrangements, as agreed between the employee and their
manager, are to be used.

15.

Part-time employees will be paid fortnightly, in arrears, based on the following formula:

Fortnightly pay =

16.

annual salary x 12
313

x

Part-time ordinary hours of
work
Full-time ordinary hours of
work

Leave (unless otherwise provided for by legislation) and other entitlements of part-time
employees will be calculated on a pro rata basis, based on the proportion of hours
worked in comparison to full-time hours.
Page 6 of 40

17.

Paragraph 16 does not apply to allowances of a reimbursement nature. In such
instances, the part-time employee will receive the same allowance amount as a fulltime employee.

Casual employees
18.

Casual employees are employees who are engaged under paragraph 22(2)(c) of the
Public Service Act 1999 (PS Act).

19.

Casual employees will be paid fortnightly, in arrears, based on the following formula:

Fortnightly pay =

annual
salary x 12
313

÷ 75 x

Actual hours
worked in fortnight

x

1.2

20.

The formula in paragraph 19 includes a 20 per cent casual loading. This loading is paid
in lieu of public holidays not worked and paid leave, with the exception of long service
leave.

21.

Unless specified elsewhere in this agreement, casual employees are not entitled to
paid leave.

Part C - Remuneration
Classifications and salary rates
22.

The classifications and salary rates applicable during the term of this agreement are
provided at Attachment A.
The salary rates will increase:
On the commencement date:
12 months from commencement date:
24 months from commencement date:

2.0%
2.0%
2.0%

Supported salary rates for employees with a disability
23.

An employee with a disability who is eligible for a supported wage will be paid the
applicable percentage as set out in Attachment B of the relevant salary rate for which
the employee is engaged.

Fortnightly pay
24.

Employees will be paid fortnightly, in arrears.

25.

Payment will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) into a financial institution
account of the employee’s choice.

Salary on commencement of this agreement
26.

On commencement of this agreement, where an existing employee’s current salary
exceeds the maximum salary for their classification, the employee’s salary will be
maintained until such time as it is exceeded by the maximum salary for their
classification.

Salary on engagement, promotion, movement
27.

Where an employee commences employment, or an existing employee is promoted to
a higher classification, in the Agency, the Fair Work Ombudsman will determine their
salary, having regard to the experience, qualifications and skills of the employee.
Page 7 of 40

28.

When an employee moves at the same classification level from another Australian
Public Service (APS) Agency and their salary is:
a. above the top pay point of the relevant range as stated at Attachment A, they
will be paid at the top pay point unless a higher salary is agreed to by the Fair
Work Ombudsman or
b. below the top pay point of the relevant range as stated at Attachment A, but
not aligned with a pay point in the range, their salary will be paid at the next
highest pay point in that range.

Salary advancement
29.

Salary advancement (movement to a higher pay point within a classification) will occur
for eligible ongoing and non-ongoing employees from 1 July each year. There will be
no salary advancement at any other time in the year. The actual payment of salary at
the higher pay point will generally commence from the beginning of the first full pay
period commencing on or after 1 August each year, back paid to 1 July. To be eligible
for salary advancement, an employee must:
a. complete the requirements of the Performance Policy and
b. achieve a rating of ‘Meets Expectations’ or better in the Performance Rating
Scale at the end of the performance cycle and
c. perform duties at the employee’s substantive level or above, within the
Agency, for an aggregate of three months or more within the performance
cycle ended 30 June and
d. have successfully completed the probationary period where one applies.

30.

When an ongoing employee has been temporarily reassigned to duties at a higher
classification for a period aggregating three months or longer during the performance
cycle and is performing duties of this higher classification on 1 July, the employee will
be eligible for salary advancement at this higher classification for the period of
Temporary Performance Loading (TPL) from 1 July onwards. The employee must
achieve a rating of ‘Meets Expectations’ or better in the Performance Rating Scale at
the higher classification at the end of the performance cycle, based on performance
expectations set at the higher classification.

Salary packaging
31.

Employees may choose to sacrifice part of their salary from a selection of non-cash
benefits. Participation in salary packaging will not affect salary for superannuation
purposes or any other purpose.

Overpayment of entitlements
32.

Where an employee is overpaid an amount of salary or other remuneration, the
amount of the overpayment may be recovered from amounts payable to the employee
by deductions authorised by the employee or by the Agency’s Accountable Authority
Instructions. A recovery payment plan will be considered by the Fair Work
Ombudsman in circumstances of financial hardship.

Superannuation
33.

The Agency will provide employer superannuation contributions in accordance with the
relevant legislative requirements.

34.

The default fund for the Agency is the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation
Plan (PSSap).

35.

The salary for superannuation purposes for PSSap members or those who choose
another fund will be calculated based on the employee’s Ordinary Time Earnings
(OTE) within the meaning of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.
Page 8 of 40

36.

Employer contributions to the PSSap will be 15.4% of the employee’s OTE. Employer
contributions for employees in other accumulation schemes will be at the same rate as
for employees in PSSap. Employer contributions will not be reduced by any other
contributions made through salary sacrifice arrangements. This clause does not apply
where a superannuation fund cannot accept employer superannuation contributions.

37.

An employee may choose any approved superannuation fund as long as the fund can
accept employer contributions by EFT. Any fees associated with EFT will be borne by
the Agency.

38.

For employees who take paid or unpaid parental leave (which includes maternity,
adoption, supporting partner, primary caregiver and foster care leave), employer
contributions (based on the employer contribution amount in the full pay period
immediately prior to commencing parental leave) will be made for a period equal to a
maximum of 52 weeks, in accordance with the rules of the appropriate superannuation
scheme. For employees in PSSap, the rules permit employer contributions to be made.

Part D – Allowances and assistance
Corporate citizen allowance
39.

An allowance of $27.54 will be paid to appointed employees on a fortnightly basis for
undertaking the following corporate citizen roles:
a.
b.
c.
d.

40.

First Aid Officers
Chief, Floor and Area Wardens
Health and Safety Representatives and
Harassment and Diversity Contact Officers.

This allowance will be increased in line with general wage increases under this
agreement so that fortnightly total amounts are:
a. On the commencement date:
b. 12 months from commencement date:
c. 24 months from commencement date:

41.

$27.54
$28.09
$28.65

Employees who are authorised by the Fair Work Ombudsman to undertake more than
one of the above corporate citizen roles will only receive one payment of the allowance
per fortnight. Where an employee is absent for a period (except a period of Long
Service Leave) of more than four weeks the allowance will not be payable during the
period of the absence.

Community language allowance
42.

The Fair Work Ombudsman may approve payment of a community language
allowance of $714 per annum, paid on a fortnightly basis to an employee with the
required level of competency, as determined by the Fair Work Ombudsman, where
there is an identifiable and continuing need for particular skills in a language other than
English.

43.

This allowance will be increased in line with general wage increases under this
agreement as follows:
a. On the commencement date:
b. 12 months from commencement date:
c. 24 months from commencement date:

$714.00
$728.28
$742.85

Page 9 of 40

Professional payments assistance
44.

The Agency will pay for professional practice, membership or other fees for those
employees in positions where the Fair Work Ombudsman has determined that those
professional skills, qualifications and memberships are required.

Motor vehicle allowance
45.

When the Fair Work Ombudsman authorises an employee to use a private motor
vehicle for official purposes, the employee will receive a motor vehicle allowance of 68
cents per kilometre.

Additional costs assistance
46.

The Fair Work Ombudsman may reimburse additional costs arising from operational
requirements, and other costs borne by the employee in the course of their
employment.

Study assistance
47.

Study assistance, which may include paid or unpaid other leave and/or reimbursement
of costs, may be provided to eligible employees. Further information is contained in the
Study Assistance Guide.

Work related travel
48.

An employee who is required to travel on official business will not be out of pocket for
the reasonable costs of accommodation, meals, incidentals and other travel expenses
incurred.

49.

Work related travel, where possible, should be undertaken during the normal
bandwidth, and time recorded according to flextime (APS Level 1-6) or Time Off in Lieu
(Executive Level 1-2) arrangements. An employee’s personal circumstances will be
considered when organising and approving work related travel.

50.

If the Fair Work Ombudsman and employee agree that the travel is to be undertaken
outside the normal bandwidth, TOIL will be granted to the employee at ordinary time
rates. If the employee is directed to undertake travel outside the normal bandwidth,
TOIL will be granted to the employee using the same calculation as would be used for
the calculation of overtime pay. For Executive Level 1-2, this will be in accordance with
TOIL arrangements for Executive Level 1-2 at paragraphs 92 - 94.

51.

Where an employee is required to undertake travel for less than one day, but
commences before 7.00 am or concludes after 7.00 pm in the State/Territory where
they work, they:
a. will be eligible for a non-acquittable cash payment of $20 per day or
b. may use their travel card to purchase the meals (breakfast, lunch or dinner) for
which the employee is away from the home locality to the value of those
specified in the relevant policy or guide. The purchase of the meal must be
accompanied by a receipt or statutory declaration and the expenditure must be
acquitted.

52.

Further information is contained in the Domestic Travel Policy.

Transition to retirement
53.

To assist employees with retirement planning, employees aged 54 years and over who
are approaching or genuinely considering retirement, may access financial assistance
in the form of a one-off reimbursement payment up to a total maximum of $500
(inclusive of GST) to obtain financial advice from a registered financial advisor. This
financial assistance is not available to excess employees (Part J).
Page 10 of 40

54.

In addition, employees aged 54 and over who are approaching retirement may elect to
work on a part-time basis until retirement.

Grandfathered remote localities assistance
55.

Employees who are in receipt of remote localities assistance on the commencement of
this agreement will continue to receive the remote localities assistance until they are no
longer employed in the Darwin office.

56.

Where an employee who was eligible for remote localities assistance ceases to be
eligible for this assistance, they cannot become eligible again at a later date.

57.

The remote localities assistance, payable on a fortnightly basis, is:
a. for employees with dependents, $10,000 per annum
b. for employees without dependents, $6,000 per annum.

Part E – Flexible working arrangements
58.

The Agency is committed to providing flexible working arrangements to assist
employees to achieve work/life balance.

59.

Any employee may request flexible working arrangements. Where a request is refused,
the written response will include reasons for the refusal.

60.

A request made in accordance with section 65 of the Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act)
must be in writing and set out details of the change to working arrangements sought
and of the reasons for the change. The Fair Work Ombudsman will respond in writing
to the request within 21 days and will only refuse on reasonable business grounds.
Where the request is refused, the response will include reasons for the refusal.

Working from home
61.

An employee and the Fair Work Ombudsman may agree to the employee working from
home on either a regular, temporary or intermittent basis.

Job sharing
62.

The Fair Work Ombudsman may approve job sharing arrangements between two or
more employees subject to operational requirements. The details of any job sharing
arrangement, including the duration, will be agreed in writing between the manager
and the employees involved.

Individual flexibility arrangement
63.

The Fair Work Ombudsman and an employee covered by this enterprise agreement
may agree to make an individual flexibility arrangement to vary the effect of terms of
the agreement if:
a. the agreement deals with one or more of the following matters:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

arrangements about when work is performed
overtime rates
penalty rates
allowances
remuneration and/or
leave and leave loading and

b. the arrangement meets the genuine needs of the Agency and employee in
relation to one or more of the matters mentioned in paragraph 63 a and
c. the arrangement is genuinely agreed to by the Fair Work Ombudsman and
employee.
Page 11 of 40

64.

The Fair Work Ombudsman must ensure that the terms of the individual flexibility
arrangement:
a. are about permitted matters under section 172 of the FW Act
b. are not unlawful terms under section 194 of the FW Act
c. result in the employee being better off overall than the employee would be if no
arrangement was made.

65.

The Fair Work Ombudsman must ensure that the individual flexibility arrangement:
a. is in writing and
b. includes the name of the Agency and employee and
c. is signed by the Fair Work Ombudsman and employee and if the employee is
under 18 years of age, signed by a parent or guardian of the employee and
d. includes details of:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

the terms of the enterprise agreement that will be varied by the
arrangement and
how the arrangement will vary the effect of the terms and
how the employee will be better off overall in relation to the terms and
conditions of his or her employment as a result of the arrangement and
states the day on which the arrangement commences and ceases.

66.

The Fair Work Ombudsman must give the employee a copy of the individual flexibility
arrangement within 14 days after it is agreed to.

67.

The Fair Work Ombudsman or employee may terminate the individual flexibility
arrangement:
a. by giving no more than 28 days written notice to the other party to the
arrangement or
b. if the Fair Work Ombudsman and employee agree in writing — at any time.

Part F – Working hours
The standard day
68.

The standard day is defined as being worked from 8.30 am to 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm
to 5.00 pm (7 hours 30 minutes per day).

69.

A manager and employee may agree to a different pattern of hours by which the
employee will meet their ordinary hours of duty.

70.

When determining working patterns, managers and employees should consider:
a. the period of time in which all employees are required to attend, for the team or
work area
b. any other relevant issues for the team or work area.

71.

An employee will not normally be expected to work more than:
a. 10 hours ordinary time on any day or
b. five consecutive hours without a meal break of at least 30 minutes.

72.

Where this does occur, overtime and Time Off in Lieu (TOIL) provisions at paragraphs
89 to 98 and meal allowance provisions at paragraph 100 may apply.

73.

If employees are required to work in excess of their ordinary hours over a settlement
period, managers will consult with the affected employees about appropriate
recompense through TOIL and overtime provisions.

74.

The bandwidth of hours in which an employee may work their ordinary hours are
7.00 am to 7.00 pm Monday to Friday, or as otherwise agreed on an individual basis
between the Fair Work Ombudsman and employee.
Page 12 of 40

Flextime scheme
75.

Flextime is a system of flexible working arrangements that enables employees and
managers to vary working hours, patterns and arrangements to provide maximum
organisational flexibility with benefit to employees, customers and the Agency. A
business unit may decide to implement the flextime scheme by means of a scheduled
accumulated day off.

76.

All employees covered by this agreement are required to accurately record their
working hours, including break times and any leave.

77.

APS Level 1-6 employees are eligible to accrue flextime for duties performed in excess
of their ordinary hours of work (over the settlement period), but which does not attract
overtime, where it is operationally feasible to do so and is agreed by the manager.

78.

APS Level 1-6 employees temporarily assigned duties at Executive Level 1-2 are not
eligible to accrue flextime during the period of reassignment.

Insufficient work
79.

An employee cannot work hours in addition to ordinary hours to accrue flextime where
there is insufficient work.

Flextime credit balance
80.

Employees may carry over a maximum credit of 37 hours 30 minutes (pro-rata for parttime employees) of flextime accumulated in any settlement period into the next
settlement period.

Cash out of flextime credits exceeding 37 hours 30 minutes
81.

The Fair Work Ombudsman may approve the cashing out of flextime credits at ordinary
time rates at the end of a settlement period where flextime credits exceed the
maximum credit of 37 hours 30 minutes.

Flextime debit balance
82.

Employees may carry over a maximum debit of 10 hours of flextime accumulated in
any settlement period into the next settlement period.

83.

In circumstances where the maximum debit is exceeded at the end of a settlement
period, the manager and employee will endeavour to reduce the debit to the maximum
allowable (or lower) over the next settlement period.

Deduction of flextime debit from salary
84.

Should this not occur, the amount by which the maximum is exceeded shall be treated
as leave without pay and deducted from the employee’s salary. Alternatively, with their
manager’s approval, an employee may use accrued annual leave to offset any flextime
debit.

Flextime balances at cessation
85.

Where any flextime credits are outstanding at cessation of employment with the
Agency, these will be paid to the employee at ordinary rates. Where any flextime debits
are outstanding at cessation, these will be recovered from any termination payment.

Reversion to standard day
86.

When an employee has failed to comply with the provisions of flextime, the Fair Work
Ombudsman may remove access to flextime provisions for that employee for a
specified period and the employee will revert to working the standard day. Access to
flextime will be restored where the Fair Work Ombudsman is satisfied that the
employee will maintain satisfactory attendance patterns.

When an employee is absent from work without approval, reasonable efforts will be
made to contact the employee and to establish the reason for the unauthorised
absence.

provided under this agreement will cease to be available until the employee resumes
work or is granted leave.

Overtime and time off in lieu (TOIL)
APS Level 1-6
89.

On occasion and with provision of reasonable notice, employees may be required to
work overtime. APS Level 1-6 employees will be entitled to payment of overtime in
accordance with paragraph 96 where they are required to perform work and preagreement from their Manager has been attained:

b.
c.
d.

outside the bandwidth (except when travelling, refer to paragraph 50)
on a public holiday
in excess of 10 hours on any one day or
outside a part-time employee’s ordinary hours of work.

90.

In exceptional circumstances, where an employee is directed to work overtime, the Fair
Work Ombudsman may approve access to overtime for all work performed outside the
ordinary hours (plus any additional hours, if relevant) on any one day.

91.

An employee may elect to take TOIL at the equivalent overtime rate instead of
payment of overtime as calculated according to paragraph 96.

Executive Level
92.

Executive Level employees often have extra, irregular and non-ongoing demands
placed upon them, including working beyond ordinary hours. Their remuneration
recognises the additional demands which may be placed upon them.

93.

Where an Executive Level employee has been required to work substantially in excess
of ordinary hours, the Fair Work Ombudsman may provide reasonable time off in lieu
for hours worked. This will not normally be on an hour-for-hour basis.

94.

Executive Level employees are not generally entitled to overtime. However, the Fair
Work Ombudsman may approve overtime payments for excess hours worked in
exceptional circumstances.

Part-time employees
95.

A part-time employee directed to perform work in excess of the agreed hours of duty
over the settlement period and who has not elected to receive flextime for such will be
eligible for overtime in accordance with paragraphs 89 to 91 and 94.

Calculation
96.

Overtime is calculated at the following rates:
Monday to Saturday

Time and one half for the first three
hours each day, and double time

Public Holidays

Double time and one half
Page 14 of 40

Non-continuous duty
97.

Where a period of overtime is not continuous with ordinary duty, the minimum overtime
payment is four hours at the relevant rate. Where the period of overtime is greater than
four hours, payment will be made for the actual period worked at the relevant rate.

Continuous duty
98.

Overtime is considered to be continuous with ordinary duty when an employee does
not have a break, other than a meal break, between the periods of ordinary duty and
overtime.

Call in allowance
99.

An employee, up to and including an Executive Level 1 employee, who is called to
work to meet an emergency outside the ordinary (or agreed) bandwidth will be paid at
double time for the period of work and any time necessarily spent in travelling to and
from the work site. The minimum payment for such work will be two hours at double
time.

Meal allowance
100. Where an employee is directed to work overtime for a continuous period to the
completion of or beyond a meal period, they will be paid a meal allowance of $22.05.
An employee who performs overtime at home is not eligible for a meal allowance.

i. any other day, or part-day, declared or prescribed by or under a law of a State
or Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a region of
the State or Territory, as a public holiday, other than a day or part-day, or a
kind of day or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work Regulations from
counting as a public holiday.
102. If, under a State or Territory law, a day or part-day is substituted for one of the public
holidays listed above, then the substituted day or part-day is the public holiday.
103. The Fair Work Ombudsman and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day
or part-day that would otherwise be a public holiday, having regard to operational
requirements.
104. In accordance with section 116 of the FW Act, where an employee, is absent from his
or her normal employment on a day, or part-day, that is a public holiday, they will be
paid at the employee’s normal rate of pay for the employee’s ordinary hours of work on
the day or part-day.
105. Where an employee works on a public holiday, the employee will be entitled to
overtime or TOIL, which will be calculated at double time and one half in accordance
with paragraphs 89 to 98.

Page 15 of 40

106. Where a public holiday occurs in a period of annual or personal/carer’s leave, the
public holiday will not be deducted from the employee’s annual or personal/carer’s
leave credits respectively.
107. Where an employee is on a period of leave without pay and a public holiday occurs,
the employee will not be entitled to payment for the public holiday.
108. If under a law of a State or Territory every Sunday is declared or prescribed by or
under that law to be a public holiday, there is no entitlement to receive payment as a
public holiday if the employee would have worked, or does perform work, on that day.
In these circumstances, payment will only be made at the public holiday rate of pay if
the employee performs work on that day, and the Sunday would otherwise be a public
holiday under paragraph 101 a to i.
109. If under a law of a State or Territory Easter Tuesday is declared or prescribed by or
under that law to be a public holiday, there is no entitlement to receive payment as a
public holiday if the employee would have worked, or does perform work, on that day.

Make up time for substituted day
110. Where an employee cannot work on the day for which a substituted holiday has been
granted, they will make up that time through mutual agreement with their manager,
without entitlement to payment for overtime.

Annual closedown
111. Employees will be provided paid time off from 12.30 pm on the working day
immediately prior to Christmas Day and for the days between Christmas and New
Year’s Day which would otherwise be working days. If an employee agrees to work
following a call for volunteers over this period, for days other than public holidays, they
will be provided with TOIL to be taken at an alternative time convenient to the
employee and agreed with their manager. If an employee is directed to work, overtime
will apply in accordance with paragraphs 89 to 98.
112. If an employee elects to work on the next normal working day after the Boxing Day
holiday (previously known as the public service holiday), an employee may elect to
receive TOIL or payment of overtime in accordance with paragraphs 89 to 98.
113. Part-time employees normally not working on the days of the week on which the

basis.
126. Subject to approval, employees who are newly engaged in the Australian Public
Service may take up to four days in advance of accruing an entitlement (pro rata for
part-time employees) of personal/carer’s leave in the first three months of their
employment. Any leave taken in advance of its accrual will be offset against future
accruals.
127. The Fair Work Ombudsman may allow an employee to take paid personal/carer’s
leave in advance of accruing an entitlement to paid leave in exceptional circumstances
and where current personal/carer’s leave credit has been exhausted. Any leave taken
in advance of its accrual will be offset against future accruals.
128. Where personal/carer’s leave has been taken in advance of its accrual and the
employee ceases employment with the Agency, the value of any paid leave that has
been taken but not accrued by the employee will be treated as an overpayment of
entitlements.
129. An existing APS employee who has joined the Agency and has received an annual
credit of personal/carer’s leave from their former Agency during the 12 months prior to
joining the Agency, will transition to a monthly accrual at the next anniversary date of
their last personal/carer’s leave accrual.

136. In exceptional circumstances, such as chronic illness, where it is not reasonably
practicable to provide evidence for each absence in excess of ten days in a calendar
year, employees may provide medical evidence for a defined period.
137. Acceptable evidence will be evidence that would satisfy a reasonable person that the
leave was taken in accordance with paragraph 124. Medical evidence from registered
health practitioners will be accepted for the purpose of personal illness or injury or
where required to undertake carer’s responsibilities. Where it is not reasonably
practicable to provide medical evidence from a registered health practitioner, a
statutory declaration signed by the employee will be accepted.

Re-crediting periods of approved leave
138. The Fair Work Ombudsman may approve personal/carer’s, compassionate, or other

of the request for unpaid carer’s leave. Medical evidence from registered health
practitioners will be accepted for the purpose of caring responsibilities due to illness or

maternity leave in accordance with the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees)
Act 1973.
153. Employees may elect to have the payment for this leave spread over a maximum of 24
weeks at a rate no less than half normal salary. Where payment is spread over a
longer period, a maximum of 12 weeks of the leave period will count as service. The
other weeks that do not count as service do not break the employee’s continuous
service with the Agency.

Additional paid maternity leave
154. Employees are entitled to take an additional four weeks paid leave to be taken
immediately following the paid period of maternity leave provided for under the
Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973. The additional four weeks

160. A primary caregiver may elect to have the payment for this leave spread over 32
weeks at a rate of half normal salary. Where the payment is spread over a longer

weeks that do not count as service do not break the employees’ continuous service
with the Agency.
161. Primary caregiver’s leave is available for a maximum period of 16 weeks commencing
from the date of birth of the child (or 32 weeks, if taken at half pay).
162. Where a primary caregiver’s partner has accessed, or intends to access, employerprovided parental leave, the primary caregiver may only access paid primary
caregiver’s leave on a non-concurrent basis (i.e. not whilst the employee’s partner is
accessing employer-provided parental leave) so that the combined period of parental
and primary caregiver’s leave does not exceed 16 weeks (or 32 weeks at half pay).
163. Applications for primary caregiver’s leave must be supported by a signed statutory
declaration which must include:
a. a statement to the effect that the employee concerned is the primary caregiver
for a child and the duration of the caring arrangements and

Ombudsman to agree to an extension of unpaid parental leave for a further period of
up to 12 months immediately following the end of the available parental leave period
(in accordance with section 76 of the FW Act).
168. Paragraph 167 does not apply to employees covered by the Maternity Leave

placement of the child and must be taken within eight weeks of the child being adopted
or fostered.
173. Paid adoption and foster care leave may be taken over 32 weeks at a rate of half
normal salary. Where the payment is spread over a longer period, a maximum of 16
weeks of the leave period will count as service. The other weeks that do not count as
service do not break the employee’s continuous service with the Agency.
174. Applications for adoption or foster care leave must be supported by evidence which
must include:
a. a signed statutory declaration that provides:
i. a statement to the effect that the employee concerned is the primary
caregiver for the child, and

sabbatical leave by agreeing to forgo 20% of their eligible salary on each payday in
each of the four years immediately prior to going on one year’s sabbatical leave.
184. During the sabbatical year, employees will be paid an amount equivalent to the total
amount forgone from salary for the previous four years, in equal fortnightly instalments.
185. Should an employee cease employment with the Agency or otherwise leave the
scheme, the Agency will pay the employee the balance of any amount forgone during
the four year period.

208. In some circumstances other available leave types may be more appropriate for an
employee to access, this will be considered on a case by case basis.
209. Additional support regarding external services available to someone experiencing
domestic or family violence may be provided to an individual by HR or by a FWO
recognised Domestic and Family Violence Contact Officer.

Return to duty from unpaid leave
210. On return to duty from any leave without pay which counts as service, leave credits
(except for personal/carer’s leave) will be calculated and applied in accordance with
this agreement and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. In
the case of personal/carer’s leave, the employee will accrue 18 days per year for the
period of absence.

Portability of leave
211. Where an employee joins the Agency from an employer staffed under the PS Act, the
Parliamentary Service Act 1999, or from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Public
Service, accrued annual leave and personal/carer’s leave (however described) will be
transferred or recognised provided there is no break in continuity of service. Future
leave entitlements will accrue at the rate applying in the Agency.

212. Where a non-ongoing employee of the Agency becomes an ongoing employee, the

employee’s accrued annual and personal/carer’s leave will be recognised, provided
there is no break in continuity of service.

Recognition of prior service
213. Prior service with organisations where the employee was previously employed under
the PS Act, the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, or from the ACT Public Service, where
there has been a break in service, for reasons other than redundancy, may be
recognised for personal/carer’s leave purposes if the break in service is not more than
two calendar months. Prior service will be recognised for long service leave purposes
in accordance with the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.

Page 24 of 40

Exceptional circumstances
214. The Fair Work Ombudsman may, in exceptional circumstances, recognise a period of
service for personal/carer’s leave purposes.

Part H – Performance management
215. All employees will be required to genuinely and actively participate in performance
management activities.
216. All employees will receive a performance rating at the end of the performance cycle
which will reflect their performance for key outcomes and observable behaviours.
217. The following principles underpin our performance management practices:
a. Managers have a responsibility to lead and manage for performance.
Performance refers to the achievement of key deliverables and the
demonstration of behaviours.
b. Employees will participate in performance and feedback discussions.
c. Where underperformance is identified, the affected employee(s) will work with
their manager(s) to attain and sustain the standards required.
d. Procedural fairness is applied in all performance practices.
e. An employee may be supported by a person of their choice.
218. Further information is contained in the Performance Policy and the Performance
Improvement Guide.

Part I – Workforce management and planning
Broadbanding
219. The Agency has established a broadband for the APS classifications 3, 4, 5 and 6,
known as the General Broadband. Movement and salary progression through the
General Broadband is not automatic and can only occur when:
a. there is an ongoing position available at the higher classification and
b. there has been an assessment of the employee’s work related qualities,
including the necessary qualifications, skills, behaviour and experience to
undertake the higher level work or
c. an employee has undertaken a mandatory training or development programme
where progression is subject to the programme’s outcomes or
d. an employee is successful in an open merit selection process consistent with
paragraph 10A(1)(c) and 10A(2) of the PS Act.
220. Movement through the General Broadband to a higher classification will only be
available to ongoing employees whose performance has been assessed as “Meets
Expectations” or higher under the Performance Policy.
221. A decision as to whether to implement movement to a higher classification through the
General Broadband or merit selection remains at the discretion of the Fair Work
Ombudsman.

Temporary reassignment of duties
222. The Fair Work Ombudsman may temporarily reassign an employee to other duties as
set out in the PS Act.
223. Requests to participate in internal temporary transfers as a result of a successful
Expression of Interest will be genuinely considered. Where a request is refused, a
written response will be provided, upon request, including reasons for the refusal.
Page 25 of 40

Reassignment to a lower classification
224. Where an employee temporarily or permanently moves to a lower classification level at
their own request, by consent or at the direction of the Fair Work Ombudsman, the Fair
Work Ombudsman will determine a salary within the lower classification salary range,
having regard to the experience, qualifications and skills of the employee, and the
circumstances under which the reduction occurred. Normally, the salary will be at the
top of the salary range of the lower classification. In the case of a temporary
reassignment to a lower classification, such determination will specify the period for
which the lower salary will apply.

Reassignment to a higher classification
225. To be temporarily reassigned to a higher level and recommended for payment of TPL,
an employee must have been assessed as ‘Meets Expectations’ or better in the
Performance Rating Scale in their substantive classification or above, under the most
recent performance cycle assessment, or where the manager otherwise certifies that
the employee is meeting expectations and is capable of filling the higher level position.

Period of TPL attracting payment
226. TPL is payable where an employee is engaged in and performs the duties at a higher
classification for an approved period of temporary reassignment.

Level of payment
227. When an employee is to be paid TPL, the employee will be paid at the pay point
nominated by the Fair Work Ombudsman. Normally, this would be at the minimum pay
point of the relevant salary range.
228. The pay point attained through salary advancement in previous periods of TPL at that
classification level will be at least maintained.

Reassignment to SES classification
229. A non-SES employee who is temporarily reassigned to perform work at an SES
classification, will be paid at a rate determined by the Fair Work Ombudsman for the
period of temporary reassignment.

Payment for partial performance
230. Where the full range of duties of the position at a higher classification are not being

undertaken by the employee, the Fair Work Ombudsman may determine payment at a
point in a classification below that of the higher classification.

Public holidays or leave
231. An employee in receipt of TPL who is granted paid leave or who observes a public
holiday will continue to receive TPL, having regard to the provisions of this agreement,
during their absence. TPL will not be paid beyond the date on which the employee
would have ceased the period of temporary reassignment had they not been absent.
Where the period of leave is paid at less than full pay, payment of TPL will be made on
a pro rata basis.

Part J - Management of excess employees
232. The Agency is committed to assisting employees to pursue redeployment opportunities
within the Agency or other APS Agencies.
233. The following redeployment and redundancy provisions only apply to ongoing
employees who are not on probation.
Page 26 of 40

Definition of “excess”

234. An employee is excess if:
a. the employee is included in a class of employees employed in the Agency
which class comprises a greater number of employees than is necessary for
the efficient and economical working of the Agency
b. the services of the employee cannot be effectively used because of
technological or other changes in the work methods of the Agency or changes
in the nature, extent or organisation of the functions of the Agency or
c. where the duties usually performed by the employee are to be performed at a
different locality, the employee is not willing to perform duties at the locality,
and the Fair Work Ombudsman has determined that these provisions will apply
to that employee.

Notification of potentially excess status

235. Employees who are likely to become excess will be advised in writing by the Fair Work
Ombudsman at the earliest practicable time.

Consultation period

236. A period of consultation of up to four weeks will occur with the employee and if
requested by the employee, their representative, to consider:
a. actions that might be taken to reduce the likelihood of the employee becoming
excess
b. redeployment opportunities for the employee within the Agency or another
APS Agency
c. the availability of job swaps within the Agency or another APS Agency.
237. This consultation period may be foreshortened, with the written agreement of the
employee.
238. As close to the beginning of this consultation period as possible, and at the latest by
the commencement of the consideration period, the employee will also be given
information on:
a. the amounts payable as redundancy pay, pay in lieu of notice and accrued
annual and long service leave credits
b. the taxation rules applicable to the various payments made by the Agency and
c. available outplacement assistance including financial advice, career
counselling or training relevant to the employee’s career prospects are
available for the employee. The total maximum amount payable will be $5000.
This payment is subject to the employee providing receipts or invoices from
the provider(s) to demonstrate that the service(s) have been provided.
The information is provided for guidance purposes only, and is not an offer capable of
forming a binding contract.

Voluntary redundancy
239. Only one offer of voluntary redundancy will be made to an employee in an excess or
potentially excess situation.

Consideration period
240. Where the Fair Work Ombudsman offers an employee a voluntary redundancy, the
employee will have a four week consideration period within which to accept or reject
the offer. An employee and the Fair Work Ombudsman can agree to reduce this four
week consideration period if the employee has received the information outlined in
paragraph 238.

Page 27 of 40

Redundancy payments
241. An excess employee who agrees to be voluntarily retrenched and whose employment
is terminated by the Fair Work Ombudsman on the grounds that they are excess to the
requirements of the Agency, is entitled to be paid redundancy pay as follows:
a. the sum equal to two weeks’ salary for each completed year of continuous
service and
b. a pro rata payment for completed months of service since the last completed
year of service.
This is subject to a minimum payment of four weeks and a maximum of 48 weeks’
salary and also subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under
the NES.
242. In addition, where the consideration period is reduced, the employee will be paid:
a. the unexpired portion of the consideration period as at the date of termination
and
b. any leave credits which would have accrued had the employee worked for the
entire consideration period.
243. If the employee accepts the offer, the Fair Work Ombudsman will give the employee
the required notice of termination of four weeks (or five weeks for an employee over 45
years of age) or a lesser period agreed with the employee. If the employee ceases
employment at the commencement of or within the notice period, the employee will be
paid for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
244. Redundancy payments will be calculated on:
a. the employee’s salary on the date of termination
b. TPL, where the employee has received the loading for a continuous period of
at least 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the employee is
given notice of termination of employment and
c. allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of annual
leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement
for expenses incurred, or a payment for disabilities associated with the
performance of duty.
245. The redundancy payment will be calculated on a pro rata basis for any period where an
employee has worked part-time hours during their period of service and the employee
has less than 24 years full-time service, subject to any minimum amount the employee
is entitled to under the NES.

Calculating service for redundancy pay purposes
246. Subject to paragraphs 247 and 248, service for the purposes of calculating redundancy
payments means:
a. service in the Agency
b. Government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976
c. service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a joint Commonwealth
- State body corporate in which the Commonwealth does not have a controlling
interest) which is recognised for long service leave purposes
d. service with the Australian Defence Force
e. service in another organisation where an employee was transferred from the
APS to that organisation with a transfer of function, or an employee engaged
by that organisation on work within a function is appointed as a result of the
transfer of that function to the APS and such service is recognised for long
service leave purposes.

Page 28 of 40

247. For earlier periods of service to count, there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an
offer of employment in relation to the second period of service was made and accepted
by the employee before the first period of service ended (whether or not the two
periods of service are with the same employer or Agency). Absences from work which
do not count as service for any purpose will not count as service for redundancy pay
purposes.
248. Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes are
periods of service that ceased by way of:
a. termination under section 29 of the PS Act or
b. prior to the commencement of the PS Act, by way of redundancy; retirement
on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or loss of qualifications; forfeiture of
office; dismissal or termination of probationary appointment for reasons of
unsatisfactory service or
c. voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the
employee or
d. payment of a redundancy benefit or similar payment or with the payment of an
employer financed retirement.

Relocation assistance following offer of voluntary redundancy
249. Where an ongoing employee has been relocated to a remote locality at the initiative of
the Agency and is subsequently offered and accepts that offer of voluntary
redundancy, the Fair Work Ombudsman may approve payment or reimbursement of
reasonable costs incurred in the employee’s return to their previous location.

Retention period
250. The purpose of the retention period is to provide an employee with a specific period of
time that may allow them to secure alternative employment.
251. The Fair Work Ombudsman will take all reasonable steps, consistent with efficient
operational requirements, to avoid involuntary redundancy or compulsory
redeployment. It is also the employee’s responsibility to take all reasonable steps to
identify and apply for suitable vacancies at their substantive level.
252. If an employee decides not to accept the offer of voluntary redundancy per paragraph
239 the retention period commences on the day after the expiry of the consideration
period. If the consideration period is reduced per paragraph 240, this earlier date will
be regarded as being the expiry of the consideration period. The retention period will
be:
a. 13 months for employees over 45 years of age or employees with over 20
years of service
b. seven months for other employees.
253. If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment in accordance with the NES, the
relevant period in paragraph 251 above is reduced by the number of weeks
redundancy pay that the employee will be entitled to under the NES on termination, as
at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this paragraph).

Redeployment during the retention period
254. During the retention period the employee:
a. will be assisted with attempts to find alternative employment and/or
b. may, on request, be provided with assistance in meeting reasonable travel
costs and incidental expenses incurred in seeking alternative employment
where these expenses are not met by the prospective employer and/or

Page 29 of 40

c. may be moved to a suitable position, after being given four weeks’ notice, at
the current or a lower classification as a means of securing alternative
employment. If this occurs, the employee will be paid their salary at the higher
classification level for the remainder of the retention period.
255. Employees over 45 years of age and employees in regional and remote areas may be
eligible for additional outplacement assistance (up to the value of $3,075) during the
retention period.
256. Where the Fair Work Ombudsman is satisfied that there is insufficient productive work
available for the employee during the remainder of their retention period and that there
are no reasonable redeployment prospects in the APS, the Fair Work Ombudsman
may, terminate their employment under Section 29(3)(a) of the PS Act. Upon
termination the employee will be paid a lump sum comprising:
a. the balance of the retention period less the number of weeks redundancy pay
that the employee will be entitled to under the NES and this payment will be
taken to include the payment in lieu of notice of termination of employment and
b. an amount of redundancy pay as per the NES.

Extension of the retention period due to absence from work
257. A retention period will only be extended by leave where the Fair Work Ombudsman is
satisfied that an employee is substantially incapacitated and unfit for work, based on
the opinion of a registered health practitioner nominated by the Fair Work
Ombudsman. Unless exceptional circumstances exist, a retention period will not be
extended on these grounds beyond an additional eight weeks.

Termination of employment
258. Excess employees will not have their employment terminated involuntarily if they have
not been invited to elect for voluntary retrenchment or if their election to be made
redundant voluntarily has been refused.
259. An excess employee’s employment will be terminated under section 29 of the PS Act
when their retention period ceases.
260. Where the employee is to be terminated involuntarily, the Fair Work Ombudsman will
give four weeks’ notice of termination, or five weeks for an employee over 45 years of
age or a lesser period agreed with the employee. As far as practicable, the period of
notice will be served concurrently with the retention period. If the employee ceases
employment at the commencement of or within the notice period the employee will be
paid for the unexpired portion of the notice period.

Part K – Separation
Termination at the Agency’s initiative
261. Notice of termination will be as provided for under the NES (section 117 of the FW
Act).
262. Where an ongoing employee is to have their employment terminated, the provisions of
section 29 of the PS Act will apply.

Right of review
263. To avoid doubt, this agreement does not provide the employee with any rights or
remedies in relation to the termination of, or a decision to terminate, their employment.
Termination of employment, or a decision to terminate employment, cannot be
reviewed under the dispute resolution procedure contained in this agreement or under
the review of employment related action procedures.
Page 30 of 40

Termination at employee’s initiative
264. Where an employee terminates their employment, the notice of termination required to
be given by an employee is the same as that required of an employer, except that
there is no requirement on the employee to give additional notice based on the age of
the employee concerned. The minimum period of notice is set out below:
Period
Employee’s period of continuous service
with the employer at the end of the day
the notice is given
1 Not more than one year
2 More than one year but not more than
three years
3 More than three years but not more than
five years
4 More than five years

Period
One week
Two weeks
Three weeks
Four weeks

265. The obligation to provide notice by an employee may be waived by the Fair Work
Ombudsman.
266. Where an employee resigns on a public holiday, they will be deemed to have resigned
on the last working day prior to the public holiday.

Payments on death
267. Where an employee dies, or is presumed to have died on a particular date, the Fair
Work Ombudsman may authorise a payment, to be made to the dependants or partner
or the legal representative of the employee of the amount which the former employee
would have been entitled had they ceased employment on resignation or retirement.
Long service leave credits will be paid out in accordance with the Long Service Leave
Act (Commonwealth Employees) 1976.

Part L – Working together
Diversity and Inclusion
268. The Agency is committed to promoting and supporting workplace diversity and to
creating an environment that values and utilises the contributions of people with
different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.

Consulting on workplace issues
269. The Agency is committed to consulting with employees about issues relating to the
implementation and operation of this agreement and issues affecting their entitlements
and conditions of employment, including policies, procedures, guides and guidelines.
270. The Agency communicates and consults with employees through:
a. meetings
b. the Intranet, with a minimum period of 10 working days for consultation and
c. an Agency Consultative Forum (ACF).
271. It is acknowledged that there may be circumstances where the Fair Work Ombudsman
is not able to consult with employees.
272. An individual employee’s choice to be represented will be respected by all parties in
the workplace.

Page 31 of 40

Consultation
273. Paragraph 274 to 289 are the model consultation term from the Fair Work Regulations
2009.
274. This Part applies if the Agency:

ii.
the effect the change is likely to have on the employees and
iii.
measures the Agency is taking to avert or mitigate the adverse effect of
the change on the employees and
b. for the purposes of the discussion – provide, in writing, to the relevant
employees:
i.
all relevant information about the change and including the nature of
the change proposed
ii.
information about the expected effects of the change on the employees
iii.
any other matters likely to affect the employees.
279. However, the Agency is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive
information to the relevant employees.
280. The Agency must give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised about the
major change by relevant employees.
281. If a term in this agreement provides for a major change to production, program,
organisation, structure or technology in relation to the enterprise of the Agency, the
requirements set out in paragraph 275 a and paragraphs 276 and 278 are taken not to
apply.
282. In this Part, a major change is likely to have a significant effect on employees if it
results in:
a. the termination of employment of employees or
b. major change to the composition, operation, or size of the Agency’s workforce
or to the skills required of employees or

288. The Agency must give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised about the
change by the relevant employees.
289. In this Part:

in paragraph 274.

Dealing with disputes for enterprise agreements
290. If a dispute relates to:
a. a matter arising under the agreement, or
b. the NES
this Part sets out procedures to settle the dispute.
291. An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the
purposes of the procedures in this Part.
292. In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level, by discussions between the employee or employees and relevant
supervisors and/or management.
293. If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute
may refer the matter to Fair Work Commission.
Page 33 of 40

294. The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in two stages:
a. the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it
considers appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an
opinion or making a recommendation and
b. if the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage,
the Fair Work Commission may then:
i.
ii.

arbitrate the dispute and
make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Note
If the Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available to it under the Act. A
decision that the Fair Work Commission makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for the purpose of Div 3 of Part 5.1 of
the Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made against the decision.

295. While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this Part:
a. an employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally in
accordance with established custom and practice in their substantive role that
existed prior to the dispute arising unless they have a reasonable concern
about an imminent risk to their health or safety and
b. an employee must comply with a direction given by the Agency to perform
other available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

the work is not safe or
applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the
work to be performed or
the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform or
there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.

296. The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair Work
Commission in accordance with this Part.

Part M – Relocation
Relocation assistance
297. Employees who are relocated to a different geographic location at the Agency’s
initiative, or employees who permanently relocate to a different geographic location at
their own request, may discuss a package of assistance with the relevant manager
subject to the approval by the Fair Work Ombudsman. Where relocation is at the
Agency’s initiative, the assistance must meet reasonable costs necessarily incurred
through relocation.
298. If a temporary relocation is for at least eight weeks, the employee is eligible for one
return airfare to the usual work locality during that period, and during any further eight
week period. If an employee with dependants is accompanied by all dependants, the
fare will not be granted. The airfare is to be used in the employee’s own time, and all
other costs associated with the travel will be met by the employee.
