Caroline Mathieson – born 1976
Caroline has been working as an artist for a number of years now. She values the principles of
fine art and follows these within her own arts practice. Her colour and subject matter have
matured but she maintains a naïve quality when depicting her subjects and her approach to
composition. This gives her work a gentle and at times whimsical quality. Caroline has been
using a combination of acrylics, watercolour and coloured pencil. Her works can range from still
life subjects, reference from printed material and photographs she has taken of landscapes
and other subjects.
Caroline is a dedicated worker who loves art and takes it very seriously. She continues to work
on developing her colour techniques in order to widen her pallet and have the ease of skill to
represent what she sees. Caroline works at the ArtGusto Studio once a week and enjoys
catching up with her workmates and the connections she makes with the wider arts community.
ArtGusto is a supported art studio for local artists. While our artists have genuine creative
talent, they are living with disabilities and the challenges this brings to their lives every day.

1.9.

The operation of this Agreement is supported by policies, procedures and guidelines
that do not form part of the Agreement. These policies, procedures and guidelines
will be available on the Intranet to all employees and will be updated as necessary
following reasonable consultation with the Agency Consultative Network (ACN).

1.10.

If there is any inconsistency between the policies, procedures and guidelines and the
terms of this Agreement, the express terms of this Agreement will prevail. Further

Part 2 – Consultation and workplace arrangements

Part 2 – Consultation and workplace arrangements
2.1.

The NDIA is committed to consultation and workplace relations arrangements that
are balanced, do not unreasonably favour one group of employees over another and
where communication, consultation, cooperation and input from employees on
matters that affect their workplaces are considered.

Agency Consultative Network
2.2.

The NDIA will make provision for consultative arrangements with employees, and
where employees choose, their representatives, regarding general workplace
relations matters.

2.3.

The ACN is the key mechanism for general employee consultation between
management and elected employees (ACN members).

2.4.

The composition of the ACN will be a balanced representation of the NDIA’s
workforce and will be reviewed annually.

2.5.

The ACN will be the principal forum for consultation in relation to:
a.

the review of the implementation and operation of this Agreement; and

b.

the development or review of any NDIA policies, procedures or guidelines that
support the operation of this Agreement.

2.6.

The NDIA recognises the value of the ACN as a forum for the exchange of
information on matters affecting employees.

2.7.

The ACN will have four meetings per calendar year. Extraordinary meetings and
working parties will be organised as needed to deal with matters requiring specific
attention.

2.8.

Members of the ACN will be provided with appropriate support and reasonable time
to undertake their ACN related duties as determined by the Chair. Further information
on the role, composition and member supports can be found in the ACN Charter.

procedures in this term.

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

14

Part 2 – Consultation and workplace arrangements

2.21. If:
a.

a relevant employee appoints, or relevant employees appoint, a representative
for the purposes of consultation; and

b.

the employee or employees advise the NDIA of the identity of the
representative;

the NDIA must recognise the representative.
2.22. As soon as practicable after proposing to introduce the change, the NDIA must:

discuss with the relevant employees the introduction of the change; and

b.

for the purposes of the discussion, provide to the relevant employees:

all relevant information about the change, including the nature of the
change; and

ii.

information about what the NDIA reasonably believes will be the effects of
the change on the employees; and

information about any other matters that the NDIA reasonably believes
are likely to affect the employees; and

information to the relevant employees.
2.24. The NDIA must give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised about the
change by the relevant employees.

Part 3 – Dispute resolution procedure

Part 3 – Dispute resolution procedure
3.1.

If a dispute relates to:
a.

a matter arising under this Agreement; or

b.

the NES;

this term sets out the procedures to settle the dispute.
3.2.

If you are a party to the dispute you may appoint an employee representative for the
purposes of the procedures in this part.

3.3.

In the first instance, parties to the dispute will try to resolve the matter at the
workplace level through discussions between the employees concerned and relevant
supervisors and/or management. This may include internal escalation and/or the use
of internal alternative dispute resolution methods where appropriate.

3.4.

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute a party to the dispute
may refer the matter to the FWC.

3.5.

The FWC may deal with the dispute in two stages:
a.

the FWC will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate,
including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a
recommendation; and

b.

if the FWC is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the FWC may
then:
i.

arbitrate the dispute; and

ii.

make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Note: If the FWC arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available
to it under the FWA. A decision that the FWC makes when arbitrating a dispute is a
decision for the purposes of Division 3 of Part 5.1 of the FWA. Therefore, an appeal
may be made against the decision.
3.6.

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this
provision:
a.

employees must continue to perform their work as they would normally unless
they have a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or
safety; and

b.

employees must comply with a direction given by the NDIA to perform other
available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

16

Part 3 – Dispute resolution procedure

i.

the work is not safe; or

ii.

applicable work health and safety legislation would not permit the work
to be performed; or

iii.

the work is not appropriate for you to perform; or

iv.

there are other reasonable grounds for you to refuse to comply with the
direction.

3.7.

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the FWC in
accordance with this provision.

3.8.

The dispute resolution procedure outlined in this clause cannot be used in respect of
the termination of your employment.

above the top pay point of the appropriate NDIA classification, and where your salary
will fall within the top pay point during the life of this Agreement.

5.14.

9.41.

You are entitled to access the provision for 14 weeks paid leave after you have had

under this clause in relation to the same child where adoption/foster leave has
previously been granted.

Part 9 – Leave

Portability of leave
9.81.

For the purposes of this clause:
a.

‘APS employee’ has the same meaning as the Public Service Act 1999 (PS
Act); and

b.

‘Parliamentary Service’ refers to employment under the Parliamentary Service
Act 1999.

9.82.

Where you move (including on promotion or for an agreed period) from another

leave and personal/carer’s leave (however described) will be transferred, provided
there is no break in continuity of service.

9.83.

immediately following a period of ongoing employment in the Parliamentary Service
or the Australian Capital Territory Government Service, your unused accrued annual
leave and personal/carer’s leave (however described) will be recognised.

9.84.

Where you are engaged as an ongoing employee, and immediately prior to the
engagement you were employed as a non-ongoing APS employee, the CEO may, at
your request, recognise any accrued annual leave and personal/carer’s leave
(however described), provided there is no break in continuity of service. Any
recognised annual leave excludes any accrued leave paid out on separation.

kind of day or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work regulations from
counting as a public holiday.

9.89.

If under a state or territory law, a day or part-day is substituted for one of the public
holidays listed above, then the substituted day or part-day is the public holiday.

9.90.

The CEO may approve a substitution of a day or part-day that would otherwise be a
public holiday having regard to business requirements.

9.91.

If you are absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in the place where you
are based for work purposes, you are entitled to be paid for the part or full day
absence as if that day or part-day was not a public holiday, except where you would
not normally have worked on that day.

Christmas – reduced activity period arrangements
9.92.

You will be provided with paid time off in accordance with your work pattern for the
working days from Christmas Day to New Year’s Day. Business will resume on the

will not be paid for those days.

9.95.

There will be no deduction from leave credits for the Christmas reduced activity
period.

9.96.

The CEO may determine that, due to business requirements, you may be required to
attend work on some or all of the days referred to in clause 9.92. Where this occurs,
volunteers will be sought and paid overtime at public holiday rates or provided
equivalent time off in lieu (or a combination of both) including if you are at the
Executive Level. If there are insufficient volunteers the CEO may direct certain
employees to attend for duty.

you are in a class of employees where the number in that class is greater than
the number needed for the efficient and economical working of the NDIA; or

b.

your services can no longer be used effectively because of technological or
other changes in the NDIA or changes in the nature, extent or organisation of
the functions of the NDIA; or

c.

your duties need to be performed at a different locality and you are not willing
to relocate, and no suitable alternative duties can be identified at the current
locality.

Notification and consultation
11.6.

The CEO will notify employees who are likely to become excess as early as possible
and, where they choose, their representatives will also be notified.

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

59

Part 11 – Workforce planning and adjustment

11.7.

When the NDIA becomes aware that a significant excess staffing situation may
develop, the CEO will advise relevant employees, managers and employee
representatives.

Discussion period
11.8.

Following the initial notification the CEO will write to potentially excess employees
formally notifying them of the situation and advising them of the assistance available.
At this stage potentially excess employees will be able to discuss their situation and
options with NDIA management, with this period not exceeding one calendar month.

11.9.

During the discussion period, the CEO may invite employees who are not potentially
excess to express interest in voluntary redundancy where this would facilitate the
redeployment of an employee who is potentially excess. However, you will not be
made redundant voluntarily if the CEO refuses to approve the redundancy.

11.10. The discussion period may be shortened by agreement with you and the CEO.

Voluntary redundancy
11.11. By the end of the one month discussion period, the CEO may formally offer you a
voluntary redundancy.
11.12. Excess employees will only be formally offered a voluntary redundancy once during
the redundancy process.
11.13. Where the CEO has formally offered a voluntary redundancy, you will have one month to
both consider the offer and advise the NDIA that you are either accepting or rejecting it. If
you fail to advise the NDIA of your decision by the end of the consideration period it will
be assumed you have rejected the offer of voluntary redundancy.
11.14. You will not have your employment terminated within this consideration period unless
you have requested this to occur.
11.15. Prior to, or during the consideration period, you will be provided with an estimate of your
severance pay, pay in lieu of notice, leave entitlements, relevant taxation rules and the
availability of career and financial counselling in addition to being advised about
obtaining further information relating to superannuation and relevant taxation rules.

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

60

Part 11 – Workforce planning and adjustment

11.16. The NDIA will reimburse you up to $500 (including GST) for career and/or accredited
financial counselling, if you are considering voluntary redundancy.
11.17. Employees not accepting an offer of voluntary redundancy will be covered by clauses
11.29 to 11.41 below.

Redundancy benefit
11.18. An employee who elects for redundancy with a redundancy benefit and whose
employment is terminated by the CEO under section 29 of the PSA on the grounds
that they are excess to requirements, is entitled to payment of a redundancy benefit
of an amount equal to two weeks salary for each completed year of continuous
service, plus a pro-rata payment for completed months of service since the last
completed year of service, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled
to under the NES.
11.19. The minimum payment will be four weeks salary and the maximum will be 48 weeks
salary.
11.20. The redundancy benefit will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period where
you have worked part-time hours during your period of service and you have less
than 24 years full-time service, subject to any minimum amount you are entitled to
under the NES.
11.21. For the purposes of calculating any payment, salary will include:
a.

your salary at your ongoing classification;

b.

HDA payments where you have been receiving HDA continuously for a period
of at least 12 months immediately preceding your notification of termination
date; and

c.

an allowance in the nature of salary, where that has been paid during periods
of annual leave and on a regular basis and is not a reimbursement for
expenses incurred.

Calculating service for redundancy pay purposes
11.22. In calculating a redundancy benefit, service that will count is:

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

61

Part 11 – Workforce planning and adjustment

a.

service in an APS Agency;

b.

Government Service as defined in section 10 of the LSL Act;

c.

service with the Commonwealth, which is recognised for long service leave
purposes, other than service with a Joint Commonwealth-State body or body
corporate in which the Commonwealth does not have a controlling interest;

d.

service with the ADF;

e.

service in another organisation where:
i.

you were transferred from the APS to that organisation with a transfer of
function; or

ii.

you were engaged by that organisation on work within a function and
subsequently engaged as an APS employee as a result of the transfer of
that function to the APS; and

iii.

such function is recognised for long service leave purposes.

11.23. For periods of service to count there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where the break in service is less than four weeks and occurs where
an offer of employment with the new employer was made and accepted by you
before ceasing employment with the preceding employer.
11.24. In calculating a redundancy benefit, service will not count if it ceased:
a.

on any of the grounds for termination specified in section 29 of the PSA
(including any additional grounds prescribed in the Public Service regulations);

b.

on a ground equivalent to any of these grounds in subclause 11.24.a;

c.

through voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to
you; or

d.

with the payment of a redundancy benefit or similar payment or an employerfinanced retirement benefit.

11.25. Absences from work that do not count as service for long service leave purposes will
not count as service in calculating a redundancy benefit.

Period of notice
11.26. Where an excess employee’s employment is to be terminated under section 29 of the
PSA by accepting a voluntary redundancy they will be given four weeks’ notice.

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

62

Part 11 – Workforce planning and adjustment

Employees over 45 years of age with at least five years continuous service will be
given five weeks’ notice.
11.27. If you request, and the CEO agrees, that your employment be terminated within this
notice period, you will be paid compensation for the unexpired portion of the notice
period equal to the hours you would have worked during the notice period had your
employment not been terminated.
11.28. The CEO will approve reasonable time off with full pay for you to attend necessary
employment interviews from the start of the notice period. Where expenses to attend
interviews are not met by the prospective employer, the CEO will reimburse agreed
reasonable travel and incidental expenses.

Involuntary redundancy provisions
Retention period
11.29. An excess employee who does not agree to be retrenched with the payment of a
redundancy benefit will be entitled to the following period of retention, commencing
from the date one month after the employee received their offer of voluntary
redundancy:
a.

13 months where you have 20 or more years of service or are over 45 years of
age; or

b.

seven months for all other employees.

11.30. If you are entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, the retention period at
clause 11.29 will be reduced by the number of weeks redundancy pay that you will
be entitled to under the NES on termination, as at the expiration of the retention
period (as adjusted by this clause).
11.31. The retention period will not be extended by periods of leave taken by the excess
employee unless, after considering the circumstances of the individual case, the
CEO deems an extension as a result of a period of leave taken to be reasonable.
11.32. Where the CEO is satisfied that there is insufficient productive work available for you
during the remainder of the retention period and that there are no reasonable
redeployment prospects in the APS:

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

63

Part 11 – Workforce planning and adjustment

a.

the CEO may terminate your employment under section 29 of the PSA; and

b.

upon termination, you will be paid a lump sum comprising:
i.

the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the NES under subclause) and this payment will be taken to include the payment in lieu of
notice of termination of employment; plus

ii.

your NES entitlement to redundancy pay.

Redeployment
11.33. Employees on retention will be considered in isolation from and not in competition
with other applicants when seeking assignment to another position within the NDIA.
11.34. During the retention period, the CEO:
a.

will take all reasonable steps to find alternative employment for you; and/or

b.

may reduce your classification with the appropriate notice in order to secure you
alternative employment, subject to the conditions set out in clauses 11.37 and
11.38 below.

11.35. During the retention period you will:
a.

take reasonable steps to find alternative employment; and

b.

actively participate in learning and development activities, trial placements or
other agreed arrangements to assist in obtaining a permanent placement.

11.36. Excess employees are entitled to necessary leave with pay and assistance in
meeting reasonable travel and incidental expenses when seeking alternative
employment, where these are not met by the prospective employer.

Reduction in classification
11.37. Where the CEO proposes to reduce an excess employee’s classification as a means
of securing alternative employment, the employee will be given four weeks’ notice or,
if over 45 years of age with at least five years continuous service, will be given five
weeks’ notice.
11.38. If classification reduction occurs before the end of the retention period, you will
receive payments to maintain your salary level for the balance of the retention period.
The CEO may choose to apply this provision where the reduction is to a lower level
classification and salary in another Agency where you are employed under the PSA.

National Disability Insurance Agency Enterprise Agreement 2020-2023

64

Part 11 – Workforce planning and adjustment

Period of notice – termination of the retention period
11.39. An excess employee’s employment will be terminated under section 29 of the PSA at
the end of their retention period.
11.40. Where an excess employee’s employment is to be terminated they will be given four
weeks’ notice. Employees over 45 years of age with at least five years continuous
service will be given five weeks’ notice. This notice period will, as far as practicable,
be concurrent with the employee’s retention period.
11.41. If you are terminated within this notice period, you will be paid compensation for the
unexpired portion of the notice period equal to the hours you would have worked
during the notice period had your employment not been terminated.
