expectations and may be exceeding,
or significantly exceeding, expectations
in some, most or all areas.

Performance Expectations Not Met

Performing below performance
expectations.

12.2

An employee who has been advised in writing of concerns with their performance

are assessed as Performance Expectations Met or Exceeded will have their salaries
increased by one pay point or its equivalent. Where employees’ salaries are below
pay point 2 prior to salary advancement, the equivalent of a pay point increase
equals the difference between pay point 1 and pay point 2 of the relevant salary
range.

SECTION D – CAPABILITY, DEVELOPMENT AND
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK
43.

PRINCIPLES

43.1

Effective development and performance management is fundamental to the
achievement of productivity improvement, and a culture of continuous improvement.

43.2

The ABS Development and Performance Framework is designed to increase
organisational performance by supporting all employees to maximise their
performance through individual development, job satisfaction and positive, trusted
working relationships.

43.3

All ongoing employees will actively participate in the ABS Development and
Performance Framework. The Framework aims to:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.

jointly define individual performance expectations;
link individual performance to organisational and business goals and Work
Level Standards;
facilitate constructive discussions and relationships between line managers and
employees;
assist employees to develop skills needed for the future;
foster high performance;
assist in identifying and managing performance which is below performance
expectations; and
guide salary advancement.

43.4

The Framework supports regular discussions between employees and their line
managers for the purposes of providing feedback on performance and discussing
personal development needs.

43.5

The Framework operates over a twelve month cycle, with mid cycle and end of cycle
reviews. This formalises the regular feedback and communication that occurs as part
of everyday business between line managers and employees.

43.6

Non-ongoing employees on irregular or intermittent contracts are not required to have
a formal Development and Performance Agreement but must be made aware of work
related expectations and receive regular feedback on their performance.

Non-ongoing employees (except those on irregular or intermittent contracts), whose
continuous employment in the ABS will extend for six months or more, will participate

opportunities, to assist in improving their performance to the required standard;

address these as they arise.

45.2

Where there are ongoing concerns with an employee’s performance, the line
manager will advise the employee so that they can work with them to improve
performance to the required standard. This will involve the development of a
performance improvement plan with clear and measurable objectives, provision of
regular and appropriate feedback and ongoing assessment, and provision of any
appropriate relevant training and/or coaching. All actions to improve an employee’s
performance must be documented and provided to the employee.

45.3

If the employee achieves the required standard of performance, this process will be
deemed complete.

46.

MANAGING UNDERPERFORMANCE

46.1

Where the employee does not achieve the required standard of performance during
the performance improvement process, a managing underperformance process,
involving an independent assessment, will be implemented to assess the
employee's work performance.

46.2

The ABS will appoint a person to conduct the independent assessment. In addition,
the ABS will seek to establish a work plan, consistent with the principles outlined in
clause 44.1, with the employee for the purposes of the assessment.

46.3

At the end of the managing underperformance process, if the employee has attained
and sustained the required standard of performance, this process will be deemed
complete.

13

defined timeframe, the Australian Statistician will advise the employee of the
findings and any actions proposed consistent with the Public Service Act 1999, that
is:
a. reassignment of duties; or
b. reduction in salary or classification; or

including, but not limited to:

RESOLUTION OF AGREEMENT DISPUTES

269.2

An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the

269.3

In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level, by discussions between the employee or employees and relevant
supervisors and/or management.

269.4

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the
dispute may refer the matter to Fair Work Commission.

The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in 2 stages:
a. the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers
appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or
making a recommendation; and
b. if the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage,
the Fair Work Commission may then:
i. arbitrate the dispute; and
ii. make a determination that is binding on the parties.
Note: If Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the
powers that are available to it under the Act. A decision that Fair Work
Commission makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for the purpose of
Div 3 of Part 5.1 of the Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made against the
decision.

have a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety; and

other available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
i. the work is not safe; or
ii. applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit
the work to be performed; or
iii. the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or
iv. there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to
comply with the direction.
