Part A – Consultation Arrangements
The department is committed to communicating and consulting with employees and, where
they choose, their representative about the implementation and operation of this
Determination and issues affecting their entitlements and conditions of employment.
Consultation
These provisions apply if the department:
a.

has made a definite decision to introduce a major change to production, programme,
organisation, structure or technology in relation to its enterprise that is likely to have a
significant effect on the employees or

b.

proposes to introduce a change to the regular roster or ordinary hours of work of
employees.

Major change
When a major change occurs:
a.

the department must notify the relevant employees of the decision to introduce the
major change and

b.

clauses 4-10 apply.

The relevant employees may appoint a representative for the purposes of the procedures in
these provisions.
If a relevant employee(s) appoints a representative for the purposes of consultation and the
employee(s) advise the department of the identity of the representative, the department must
recognise the representative.
As soon as practicable after making its decision, the department must:
a.

b.

discuss with the relevant employees:


the introduction of the change



the effect the change is likely to have on the employees and



measures the employer is taking to avert or mitigate the adverse effect of the change
on the employees; and

for the purposes of the discussion—provide, in writing, to the relevant employees:


all relevant information about the change including the nature of the change proposed



information about the expected effects of the change on the employees and



any other matters likely to affect the employees.

The department is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information to
the relevant employees.
The department must give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised about the
major change by the relevant employees.
If a provision in this Determination provides for a major change to production, programme,
organisation, structure or technology in relation to the enterprise of the department, the
requirements set out in clauses 3(a), 4 and 6 are taken not to apply.
A major change is likely to have a significant effect on employees if it results in:
a. the termination of the employment of employees
b. major change to the composition, operation or size of the department’s workforce or to
the skills required of employees
7

c.

the elimination or diminution of job opportunities (including opportunities for promotion
or tenure)

d. the alteration of hours of work
e. the need to retrain employees
f.

the need to relocate employees to another workplace or

g. the restructuring of jobs.
Change to regular roster or ordinary hours of work
For a change that proposes to introduce a change to the regular roster or ordinary hours of
work of employees:
a.

the department must notify the relevant employees of the proposed change and

b.

clauses 12-15 apply.

The relevant employees may appoint a representative for the purposes of the procedures in
these provisions.
If a relevant employee(s) appoint(s) a representative for the purposes of consultation and the
employee(s) advises the department of the identity of the representative, the department
must recognise the representative.
As soon as practicable after proposing to introduce the change, the department must:
a.

discuss with the relevant employees the introduction of the change; and

b.

for the purposes of the discussion—provide to the relevant employees:

c.



all relevant information about the change, including the nature of the change;



information about what the department reasonably believes will be the effects of the
change on the employees; and



information about any other matters that the department reasonably believes are
likely to affect the employees; and

invite the relevant employees to give their views about the impact of the change
(including any impact in relation to their family or caring responsibilities).

The department is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information to
the relevant employees.
The department must give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised about the
change by the relevant employees.
For the purposes of Part B, ‘relevant employees’ means the employees who may be affected by
a change referred to in clause 2.
Consultation committees
The department will establish and maintain a consultative committee for the duration of this
Determination. The committee will be the key mechanism for general staff consultation
between the department and employee representatives.
The roles and composition of the Consultative Committee will be detailed in the Consultative
Committee Terms of Reference, based on an appropriate representation of the department’s
workforce.

8

Part B – Employment classification structure
The department’s classification structures and broadbands are detailed in Attachments A, B, C
and D.
Department’s Training Broadband
The department’s Training Broadband at Attachment B is used for those employees required to
undertake a mandatory training or development programme as a condition of advancement to
the next classification within the broadband. Salary progression is subject to successful
completion of that programme.
The Secretary may assign other classifications to the department’s Training Broadband
relevant to the training and development programme being undertaken by an employee or to
ensure consistency with whole of government approaches.
Graduates
Graduates will enter the department at the APS 3 classification level within the department’s
Training Broadband. On successful completion of the Graduate Programme, Graduates will be
advanced to the APS 4 classification level within the Training Broadband, and then be moved
at the APS 4 classification level into the department’s Broadband 2.
Cadets
Employees recruited as a Cadet will undertake a course of study as determined by the
Secretary. Cadets will be assigned a classification level within the department’s Training
Broadband. On successful completion of their course of study and a final 12 week work
placement, Cadets will be assessed for advancement to the APS 3 classification level within the
department’s Broadband 1.
Trainee APS (Administrative)
Trainee APS (Administrative) employees will be assigned a classification within the
department’s Training Broadband and undertake a course of study determined by the
Secretary. On successful completion of their training requirements, the classification of Trainee
APS (Administrative) will be not less than the APS 3 classification level, subject to work being
available at the APS 3 level. They will then be integrated into the department’s Broadband 1.
Ongoing movement within a broadband
Permanent movement between classification levels within a broadband applies to ongoing
employees only.
Movement to a higher APS classification level within a broadband is not automatic and can only
occur when:
a.

there is work available at the higher level in accordance with the APS work level
standards for that classification and

b.

the employee’s performance is assessed as meeting the requirements for salary
advancement for both key business deliverables and observable work behaviours and

c.

the employee demonstrates an ability to undertake the higher level work, and if
appropriate has the necessary qualifications, skills and/or experience or

d.

an employee is successful in an open merit selection process consistent with the PS Act.

9

Part C – Remuneration
Salary
The salary rates are detailed in Attachments A, B, C and D of this Determination.
Employees, whose salary rate is above the rates for their classification in Attachment A on
commencement of this Determination, will remain on that salary until their salary falls within
the salary rates for their classification.
Employees' salary rates set out in Attachments A, B, C and D of this Determination are
adjusted:
a.

by X% with effect from 9 April 2023, where X is the applicable percentage adjustment in
salary in line with the most recently published annual June Private Sector WPI% as
advised by the Australian Public Service Commission; and

b.

by X% with effect from 9 April 2024, where X is the applicable percentage adjustment in
salary in line with the most recently published annual June Private Sector WPI% as
advised by the Australian Public Service Commission.

Departmental Liaison Officer and Workplace Responsibility allowances are adjusted on the
dates and by the percentages specified in clause 30.
Each adjustment of an allowance is to be calculated based on the allowance immediately
before the adjustment in clause 30.
Any entitlement under the APS Award will be calculated by reference to the employee's
applicable rate of pay in the APS Award.
Salary payment
An employee will be paid fortnightly in arrears by electronic funds transfer into a financial
institution account of the employee’s choice.
The fortnightly rate of salary is calculated using the following formula: annual rate of salary,
multiplied by twelve, and divided by 313.
Salary on engagement, promotion or movement
A person who is engaged to the APS by the department, an existing ongoing APS employee
promoted or moved to the department, or an existing departmental ongoing employee
promoted or moved within the broadband in the department, will be paid at the minimum
salary of the relevant classification unless the Secretary approves payment of a higher salary
within the salary range for that classification.
An ongoing employee, who immediately before a movement within the broadband or
promotion, is in receipt of Temporary Performance Loading (TPL) above the base salary due to
receiving salary advancement at the TPL classification under the salary advancement
provisions of this EA, will be paid at the higher TPL salary rate from the date of promotion or
movement.
Unless the Secretary determines a higher salary, an existing ongoing APS employee moving to
the department at the same classification level, whose salary immediately prior to transfer is
below the maximum salary in the department for that APS classification, will have their salary
rates set within the salary range for that classification at a rate closest to, but no lower than
the existing salary.
Unless the Secretary determines otherwise, an existing ongoing APS employee moving to the
department at the same classification level, whose salary in their previous APS agency exceeds
the maximum salary in the department for that classification, will be maintained on that salary

10

until such time as the salary differential is absorbed by departmental salary increases at the
relevant classification level.
Where an ongoing employee’s salary exceeds the maximum salary range at the relevant
departmental classification level and is set by an Individual Flexibility Arrangement (IFA) under
an enterprise agreement or an instrument other than an enterprise agreement, the Secretary
will determine the salary on movement to the department.
Clauses 36-40 do not apply to a departmental employee returning to the department following
a temporary movement with another agency.
If an employee’s salary is set in error at the time of engagement or promotion, the Secretary
may subsequently determine that the employee’s salary may be adjusted within the relevant
classification with effect from the date of their engagement or promotion.
Salary on reduction
Where an ongoing employee requests or agrees in writing to perform work at a lower
classification level for a specified period, salary will be determined by the Secretary at a rate
applicable to the lower level for the period specified. The rate will normally be the top of the
range of the lower classification.
Where an employee permanently reduces to a lower classification level, by consent or direction
from the Secretary, the Secretary will determine salary within the lower classification level
having regards to the experience, qualifications and skills of the employee. The rate will
normally be the top of the range of the lower classification.
Salary advancement
On 15 July each year, an ongoing employee (excluding employees under the department’s
Training Broadband), who is not already on the maximum salary, will be eligible for salary
advancement to the next pay point in their classification if the employee:
a.

has performed duties:
i. in the department; or
ii. in the performance year ending on 15 July 2022, in the former Department of
Education, Skills and Employment,
at that classification level or higher for a period of three continuous months or
more in the performance cycle; and

b.

has received ratings of ‘Meets Expectations’ (or equivalent) for both business
deliverables and observable work behaviours as part of the end cycle performance
appraisal ending 30 June each year.

Salary advancement provisions for Government Lawyers are outlined in Attachment C.
Salary advancement and Temporary Performance Loading
Where an ongoing employee is in receipt of TPL on 15 July, they will be eligible for salary
advancement at both their temporary performance and substantive levels, if they are not
already on the maximum salary, effective from 15 July, where the employee:
a.

was in receipt of continuous TPL at the same classification or higher and salary level from
1 April to 15 July that year and

b.

has received ratings of ‘Meets Expectations’ for both business deliverables and
observable work behaviours at the TPL classification as part of the end cycle performance
appraisal ending 30 June that year.

Where there is a break in TPL between 30 June and 15 July of the same calendar year the
employee is still eligible for salary advancement at both levels.
11

An ongoing employee who is promoted or moved within the broadband between 1 April and
15 July each year, and was in receipt of continuous TPL at the same classification and salary
level from 1 April to immediately before the promotion, will be eligible for salary advancement
subject to meeting the requirements in clause 45.
Part time employees
Remuneration and other benefits for part time employees will be calculated on a pro rata basis
according to hours worked, with the exception of reimbursement benefits and expense-related
allowances, which will be paid at the same amount as full time employees.
Casual employees
Casual employees are entitled to a salary loading of 20 per cent in lieu of public holidays on
which the employee is not rostered to work and all paid leave entitlements, except long service
leave. Casual employees are entitled to access unpaid compassionate leave and unpaid carers
leave of two days per each permissible occasion.
The employee's salary rate and casual loading under clause 51 includes payment for the casual
loading the employee is entitled to receive under the APS Award.
Casual loading is not paid for overtime.
Supported salary rates
Supported wage rates as set out in Attachment G will apply to an employee with disability who
is eligible for consideration under the Supported Wage System.
Junior rates
Junior rates of pay are only applicable to the APS 1 classification as detailed in Attachments A
and B.
Superannuation
The department will provide employer superannuation contributions in accordance with the
relevant legislative requirements.
The department will provide employer superannuation contributions to members of the PSSap
of no less than 15.4% fortnightly contribution salary.
The department will provide employer superannuation contributions to members of a fund
other than CSS, PSS or PSSap of no less than 15.4% ordinary time earnings.
For employees who take paid and/or unpaid parental leave (which includes maternity,
supporting partner, adoption and foster care leave), employer contributions will be made for a
period equal to a maximum of 52 weeks or as required by applicable legislation and fund
requirements . Contributions will be based on the employer contribution amount in the full pay
period immediately prior to commencing leave.
The Secretary may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying superannuation funds
that meet the SuperStream standard.
Any fees applied by a chosen fund associated with the administration of superannuation
contributions will be borne by the employee.
Salary packaging
Employees may access salary packaging and may package up to 100% of salary.
Where an employee elects to access salary packaging, the employee’s salary for the purposes
of superannuation, severance and termination payments, and any other purposes, will be
determined as if the salary packaging arrangement had not occurred.
12

Part D – Capability development
The department is committed to promoting and supporting workplace diversity and inclusion,
creating an environment that values the contributions of people with different experiences and
perspectives regardless of their race, gender identity, sexual orientation, intersex status, age,
disability, language or cultural and linguistically diverse backgrounds.
The department is an inclusive organisation that values fairness, equity and diversity,
consistent with APS values and Code of Conduct.
Study assistance
An employee undertaking formal study may be eligible to apply for study assistance, which
may include reimbursement of costs up to $3000 per year and/or a maximum of eight hours
per week paid leave (15 hours for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees), that can
be used weekly, accumulated and used as a leave bank or both.
Performance management arrangements
Employees must participate in the department’s performance management arrangements. The
performance management cycle runs from July to June each year.
All employees will be required to have a current performance agreement, except non-ongoing
employees engaged for less than three months.
For more information about the performance management processes, including the
responsibilities, rights and obligations of managers and employees in managing performance,
employees should consult the Performance Management Policy.
Managing underperformance
Where underperformance is identified, the department will work with affected employees and
their managers to attain and sustain the standards required.
Underperformance is when a manager makes an assessment that an employee’s performance
does not meet expectations.
The underperformance procedures have been developed under the principles of procedural
fairness, natural justice and provide rights to representation.
For more information on managing underperformance, employees should consult the
Underperformance Procedures.

13

Part E – Allowances
Health allowance
To assist the promotion of good health, the department will provide each employee with a
health related allowance to be paid as a lump sum on the first full pay period on or after
1 September each year as follows:
a.

APS 1–3 employees will receive $500

b.

APS 4–Executive Level 2 employees will receive $200.

Employees who have commenced a period of LWOP (other than maternity leave without pay)
for a period of six months or more on or before 1 September each year will not be entitled to
receive the health related allowance for that year.
School holiday care allowance
The department will contribute to the cost of school holiday care for primary school children of
employees required to work. If more than one carer works for the department, the allowance
will only be paid when they are both at work.
On production of a receipt from an approved school holiday programme provider, the
department will reimburse up to a maximum of $18 per child per day up to $180 per family
per week.
Departmental Liaison Officer (DLO) allowance
An employee who receives the annual DLO allowance is not entitled to claim for flex time or
any overtime worked while performing the duties of DLO. The rate of DLO allowance is
$20,789 per annum.
Workplace responsibility allowance
An ongoing employee is entitled to a workplace responsibility allowance of $28 per fortnight
where they are appointed to a workplace responsibility role and have successfully completed
any training programmes and/or refresher courses required.
A workplace responsibility role includes a First Aid Officer, Emergency Warden or Health and
Safety Representative.
If an employee undertakes more than one of the recognised workplace responsibilities they will
not be entitled to multiple payment of the workplace responsibility allowance.
Community and Indigenous Australian languages allowance
Where the Secretary determines there is a continuing need to utilise an employee's particular
language skills for communication (in languages other than English including deaf
communication skills) in providing client or staff services, the employee will be entitled to the
allowance provided in clause 11.15 of the APS Award.
Where an employee is accredited to a fluent level in a recognised Community or Indigenous
Australian language by an appropriate individual or body, and where the employee is required
to utilise the language in the delivery of the department’s programmes, the employee is
eligible to receive an allowance of $1,700 per annum instead of the allowance at clause 82,
which includes payment for any similar entitlement payable under the APS Award.
Cadet book and equipment
A cadet employee is entitled to reimbursement for all compulsory fees paid and reasonable
expenses incurred for books and equipment during the year relating to the approved study
paid for that year.
14

Remote Localities Assistance (RLA)
Where an employee is engaged or relocated to a remote locality, assistance will be provided.
Four categories have been determined for payment of RLA, depending on the level of
remoteness. The amount payable per annum for the life of the Determination is at
Attachment F. For further information, employees should consult the RLA Policy.
Temporary performance loading
TPL is payable when an employee has performed duties of a higher classification for 10
continuous working days or more.
Where the period of temporary performance is expected to be a continuous period of 10 days
or more (whether or not that expectation is realised), temporary performance loading will be
payable for the entire period worked at the higher level from the commencement of the
period.
A manager may split temporary performance duties between employees for development
purposes.
Where TPL is payable, this would normally be at the minimum salary of the higher
classification. A manager may approve payment of TPL at a salary above the minimum salary
for that classification. In considering such an approval, a manager will take into account the
employee’s previous periods of temporary performance, the employee’s performance, and
relevant experience or skills.
An employee may decline a manager’s invitation to perform duties temporarily at a higher
classification level.
An employee's substantive salary rate includes payment for the higher duties allowance under
the APS Award in any circumstance where an employee performs duties at a higher
classification for fewer than 10 days and would not be entitled to TPL under clause 87.
Temporary performance loading on leave
Where an employee is absent on paid leave, or observes a public holiday and has been
directed to perform duties at a higher classification, payment of TPL will continue during the
absence as if the employee was still at work, to the extent of the continued operation of the
direction.

15

Relocation assistance
New employees
When a new ongoing employee moves from one geographic location to another to join the
department, relocation assistance for the removal of furniture and effects and travel to the
new locality may be provided at the discretion of the Secretary.
Any assistance provided will take into account the business requirements and the monetary
limits of the relocation provisions for employee initiated moves.
Employer initiated transfers
Where the department initiates the transfer, term transfer or temporary transfer of greater
than 13 weeks from one locality to another, the employee may request a relocation assistance
package for reimbursement of reasonable expenses.
Where the transfer is initiated by the department, and the employee is an "eligible employee"
for the purposes of clause 11.5 of the APS Award, the employee will be entitled to the greater
of:
a.

the entitlements in clause 96 (which includes payment for any similar entitlements
payable under the APS Award); or

b.

the entitlements in clause 11.5 of the APS Award (in which case the entitlements in clause
96 are not payable).

Employee initiated transfer
Where an employee of the department applies for promotion or transfer at level which involves
permanently moving from one geographic locality to another, the employee may request a
relocation assistance package for reimbursement of reasonable expenses.
Employees requesting transfer to another locality for personal reasons are generally not
eligible for relocation assistance.
Where the transfer or promotion is initiated by the employee, and the employee is an
"eligible employee" for the purposes of clause 11.5 of the APS Award, the employee will be
entitled to the greater of:
a.

the entitlements in clause 98 (which includes payment for any similar entitlements
payable under the APS Award); or

b.

the entitlements in clause 11.5 of the APS Award (in which case the entitlements in clause
98 are not payable).

Disturbance allowance
Where the household effects of an existing employee, to whom the relocation provisions
apply, have been removed at departmental expense from the employee’s former locality to
the new locality, the employee is entitled to be paid a one-off disturbance allowance of $810
for an employee who relocates alone or $1,500 for an employee who relocates with a
spouse, partner or dependant.
Where an employee has received disturbance allowance at the new locality and subsequently
relocates within the new locality, no further disturbance allowance is payable.
Where an employee is an "eligible employee" for the purposes of clause 11.5 of the APS
Award, the employee will be entitled to the greater of:
a.

the disturbance allowance under clause 101 (which includes payment for any similar
entitlements payable under the APS Award); or

b.

the disturbance allowance clause 11.6(a) of the APS Award (in which case the disturbance
allowance under clause 101 is not payable).
16

Part F – Travel
Travel expenditure
An employee who undertakes travel on official business and is required to be away from
home overnight will be entitled to have actual travel expenditure within the indicative daily
cap paid for or reimbursed by the department. For further information, employees should
consult the Travel Policy.
Where the Secretary decides that the accommodation rate is insufficient in specific
circumstances, a higher rate may be approved.
Employees whose travel includes an overnight stay may withdraw up to $40 for incidentals
and meals, from an Automatic Teller Machine without the requirement to provide receipts of
expenditure. Any cash withdrawal will reduce the daily rates available for accommodation
and other meals or incidental costs by the amount withdrawn.
Where an employee chooses to stay in non-commercial accommodation, employees may
access up to $55 per night to meet expenses associated with staying in non-commercial
accommodation.
Part day travel
Where an employee is required to travel for official business purposes for a period of ten
hours or more but no overnight stay is required, a part day travel allowance of $40 will be
payable to employees.
Reviewed travel allowance
Payment arrangements and the level of entitlement for travel expenses will be reviewed
after 21 days away from home (in the one location) and paid on the basis of reasonable
actual expenses or an alternative package of assistance approved by the Secretary. A trip
home will not be regarded as a break for the purposes of determining reviewed travel
allowance.
Recognition of travel time
For APS 1–6 (and equivalent) employees, travel on official business undertaken between
7:00 am to 7:00 pm may be recorded as flex time.
Travel time will not be paid as overtime.
Reasonable time off in lieu may be granted where employees are directed to travel outside
the hours of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.
Airline lounge membership
Where it is anticipated that eight or more business trips will be required to be undertaken in
a 12 month period, airline lounge membership is available for that period.
Motor vehicle allowance
Where the Secretary authorises an employee to use their private vehicle for official business
purposes, the employee will be paid a motor vehicle allowance in accordance with the Travel
Policy, as updated from time to time.

17

Emergency situations while travelling on official business
Assistance may be authorised by the Secretary in situations where, while an employee is
travelling on official business:
a.

an employee becomes critically or dangerously ill and the employee’s partner or a family
member travels to visit the employee or

b.

a member of the employee’s family or the employee’s partner’s family dies or becomes
critically or dangerously ill and the employee travels to visit the critically or dangerously
ill family member.

The assistance may comprise:
a.

reimbursement to the employee for the cost of an economy return airfare in respect of
travel within Australia

b.

where the use of a motor vehicle is approved, or is the most appropriate form of travel,
motor vehicle allowance consistent with provisions in this Determination.

Family care expenses when travelling
When an employee with family caring responsibilities is required to travel away from home
for official purposes, the department will provide reimbursement on production of receipts
for the full cost of ‘additional commercial care’ (over normal caring arrangements).
Where commercial care is not available, the Secretary has the discretion to approve the cost
of the care provided by other arrangements. This reimbursement will be up to $60 per night
subject to provision of satisfactory evidence.

18

Part G – Flexible working arrangements
The department recognises employees have family and personal commitments and is
committed to providing flexibility in working arrangements that allow the department to be
responsive and to assist employees to balance their personal and work commitments.
An employee, including casual employees, may request flexible working arrangements
consistent with the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act).
Working hours
All employees are required to maintain a record of attendance.
Non-shiftworker full-time employees are required to work 7 hours and 30 minutes per day,
being a total of 37.5 hours per week and 150 hours per four week settlement period. This
time is made up of:
a.

ordinary hours of work of 7 hours and 21 minutes per day, being a total of 36 hours and
45 minutes per week and 147 hours per four week settlement period; and

b.

an additional 9 minutes per day, being a total of 45 additional minutes per week or
3 additional hours per settlement period. The employee's salary rate includes payment for
this additional time, including any overtime payable under the APS Award. The additional
time is treated as part of an employee's ordinary hours for all purposes under this
Determination.
Shiftworker employees are required to work ordinary hours of 7 hours and 30 minutes per
day averaged over a period of up to 28 days or the employee's roster cycle (whichever is the
longest).
For all non-shiftworker employees:

a.

the default span of hours (bandwidth) during which an employee may work their ordinary
hours is 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, Monday to Friday. The bandwidth may be varied to an
alternative 10 hour period between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm by agreement between an
employee and the Secretary; and

b.

where an employee requests to work ordinary hours during the period:
i.

between 7:00 am and 8:00 am; and/or

ii.

between the end of the bandwidth referred to in clause 124(a) and 7:00 pm,

the employee's salary rate compensates the employee for performing work in that period,
including any overtime or shift penalties payable under the APS Award. The time worked
in that period will be treated as part of an employee's ordinary hours for all purposes
under this Determination.
Employees must take a meal break at least 30 minutes after five continuous hours of work.
The maximum number of agreed working hours to be worked in a day is 10 hours, unless
also working overtime.
Employees should not commence work on any day without having at least eight hours plus
reasonable travelling time minimum break from the previous day’s work, including any
overtime worked, without specific approval from the Secretary.
Where the Secretary requires an employee to resume or continue work without having had a
minimum break, the employee will be paid at double the hourly rate for the hours worked,
until they have had an eight hour break plus reasonable travelling time.
Where all or some of the employee’s minimum break occurs during ordinary hours, the
employee will not lose pay for the absence.
Arrangements for shiftworkers are contained in Attachment E of the Determination.
19

Ordinary hours – Full time employees
An employee’s pattern of ordinary hours should be agreed between the employee and their
manager. These ordinary hours may need to be varied on occasions by either the employee
or the manager to accommodate operational or personal requirements.
Where agreement cannot be reached on the pattern of ordinary hours, the issue should be
raised with the next level manager. Where agreement cannot be reached on the pattern of
ordinary hours, the employee will work a standard day.
Part time employees
The department may engage an employee on a part time basis. An employee engaged on a
part time basis does not have an automatic right to vary their part time hours or access full
time hours.
A part time employee is an employee whose ordinary hours are less than 150 hours per
settlement period (being made up of 147 ordinary hours plus the additional time referred to
at clause 122(b)). Employees are required to work at least three continuous hours on any
agreed working day.
Employees who work part time can agree to work outside their agreed ordinary hours and
pattern of work. In such instances, part time APS employees will be entitled to access flex
time provisions, and EL employees are entitled to access time off in lieu (TOIL), subject to
the Executive Level TOIL provisions located in clauses 162-165. Where work is directed
outside an APS employee’s agreed ordinary hours, overtime rates are applicable.
An employee may request access to part time employment at any time. Managers will make
every attempt to accommodate the request having regard to both operational requirements
of the department and the personal needs of the employee.
Employees returning from maternity, parental, adoption or foster care leave will be provided
with access to part time employment, upon application, until the child reaches three years of
age. Thereafter, an employee may request flexible working arrangements in accordance with
the FW Act.
The part time hours and days of work are to be agreed between the manager and employee
having regard to operational requirements and the employee’s circumstances. Before parttime duty commences, the Secretary will issue a notice in writing to the employee which will
specify:
a.

the prescribed weekly hours of duty; and

b.

the pattern of hours to be worked including starting and finishing times for employees, on
each or any day of the week, Monday to Friday, within the limits of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm.
Where a full-time employee is permitted to work part-time for an agreed period, the notice
in writing under clause 137 will provide for the hours to be varied to full-time hours on a
specified date. The employee will revert to full-time hours unless a further period of parttime employment is approved.
The prescribed weekly hours and the pattern of hours specified under clause 137 will not be
varied, amended or revoked without the consent of the employee. Any agreed variation to
the regular pattern of hours will be recorded in writing.

Flex time
Flex time is available to all (non-shiftworker) APS level employees. All hours must be
recorded on the departmental flex sheet.
Employees accumulate flex time working between the hours of 7:00 am and 7:00 pm.

20

A flex credit is where an employee accumulates hours in excess of ordinary hours with the
agreement of their manager. The additional time referred to in clause 122(b) will not be
treated as time in excess of ordinary hours, but will be treated as part of an employee's
ordinary hours, for the purpose of calculating the employee's flex credit. An employee may
only carry over a maximum of 37.5 hours flex credit into the next settlement period. In
exceptional circumstances and where the manager has expressly agreed to the additional
hours being worked, greater than 37.5 hours may be carried over one settlement period.
In exceptional circumstances, the Secretary may:
a.

direct the excess flex leave to be taken so that the balance is below 37.5 hours or

b.

offer the employee the option to cash out flex time credits in excess of 37.5 hours at an
ordinary time rate or

c.

convert the excess credits to annual leave on a one to one basis.

A flex debit occurs when the employee works less time than their ordinary hours. The
additional time referred to in clause 122(b) will be treated as part of an employee's ordinary
hours, for the purpose of calculating the employee's flex debit. An employee may only
accrue a flex debit and carry over a maximum of 15 hours flex debit into the next settlement
period with the agreement of their manager.
Flex leave is where an employee works less than their ordinary hours on any given day and
is not on any other form of leave. The additional time referred to in clause 122(b) will be
treated as part of an employee's ordinary hours, for the purpose of calculating any flex
leave. Flex leave requires prior approval by the employee’s manager, and for periods of one
day or more reasonable notice is required.
Where there is insufficient work, a manager may require an employee not to work hours in
addition to their ordinary hours.
Where an employee’s manager considers the employee’s attendance is unsatisfactory or that
the employee is misusing flex, the employee may be required to work ordinary hours for a
period specified by the manager.
Overtime
Where operational requirements make it necessary, a manager may direct an employee to
work outside and in excess of their ordinary hours on any day.
An APS level employee directed to perform work outside and in excess of their ordinary
hours on a given day will be paid overtime, or where agreed, time off in lieu of overtime
payment at the applicable overtime rates.
A (non-shiftworker) casual employee will be entitled to overtime, but not casual loading, if
the casual employee is directed perform work:
a.

on Monday to Friday, outside the hours of 7:00 am to 7:00 pm;

b.

on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday; or

c.

in excess of 37.5 hours in a week.
Where a period of overtime is not continuous with ordinary time work, the base period of
overtime payment for such work will be calculated as if the employee had worked for four
hours. When determining whether a period is continuous with ordinary time work, meal
breaks should not be regarded as breaking continuity.
Overtime payments approved by an employee’s manager will be calculated as follows:



Monday to Saturday: one and a half times the hourly rate for the first three hours each
day and double the hourly rate thereafter



Sunday: double the hourly rate
21



Public Holiday: two and a half times the hourly rate (except for duty on a public holiday
within agreed ordinary time work, which will be paid at one and a half time the hourly
rate in addition to normal salary payment for the day).

Time off in lieu of overtime payment may be approved by an employee’s manager under
certain circumstances. Where time off in lieu of payment has been agreed and the employee
has not been granted time off within four weeks or another agreed period due to operational
requirements, payment of the original entitlement or the residual entitlement where the full
entitlement was not granted will be made.
Executive Level employees will only be eligible to receive overtime payments in exceptional
circumstances with the approval of the Secretary.
Restriction allowance
Where an employee is required to remain contactable, available and able to perform extra
duty outside their agreed ordinary hours (i.e. be restricted), they will be paid a restriction
allowance, subject to approval by the Secretary.
Restricted employees will receive a restriction allowance at the rate of nine per cent of their
ordinary hourly rate for each hour or part hour they are restricted outside their ordinary
hours, subject to:
a.

the employee remaining contactable, fit and available to perform extra duty and

b.

the employee not being in receipt of any other payment for the period for which
restriction allowance would otherwise be payable, except as provided for in the following
clause.

Restriction allowance is payable whether or not the restricted employee is required to
perform duty outside the agreed ordinary hours. Where a restricted employee entitled to
overtime payment is required to perform duty, overtime will be payable and subject to:
a.

a one hour base rate of payment when work is performed without the necessity to travel
to the workplace

b.

a three hour base rate of payment, including travel time, if work is required to be
performed at the workplace.

If an employee is required to perform subsequent periods of duty within the one hour
minimum payment period, only the initial one hour minimum is payable. Where an employee
is required to undertake a second period of duty that commences after the one hour
minimum payment period has lapsed for the first period of duty, a second one hour
minimum payment period commences and a further one hour minimum is payable.
Restriction allowance will continue to be paid for periods of overtime worked while restricted.
Emergency duty
Emergency duty will attract a base payment of two hours (which includes reasonable travel
time) at double the hourly rate, which will be payable for all emergency duty without prior
notice. Executive Level employees will only be eligible to receive emergency duty payments
in exceptional circumstances with the approval of the Secretary.
Overtime meal allowance
Where an employee (including a casual employee) who is eligible for overtime payment is
directed to work overtime for at least three hours outside their ordinary hours, their
manager will approve a flat rate overtime meal allowance at the applicable rate set by the
applicable determination made by the Australian Taxation Office as being the reasonable
amount for overtime meal allowance expenses. Where an employee works a further five
hours overtime on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, they will receive an additional
22

overtime meal allowance of the applicable rate set by the applicable determination made by
the Australian Taxation Office as being the reasonable amount for overtime meal allowance
expenses.
Executive Level employees – flexibility and time off in lieu
The hours of duty worked by Executive Level employees are not regular and Executive Level
employees may be required to work additional time beyond ordinary hours.
Executive Level employees are able to work flexible hours. This means that arrangements
for managing variations in attendance times and short-term absences, including full days,
may be agreed in advance with the manager.
Where substantial additional work is required, TOIL is able to be accessed by agreement
with the manager. TOIL will not be on an hour for hour basis or replicate a flex time system.
Reasonable requests for time off under these arrangements will not be refused, except for
operational reasons.
Working from home
Any employee may request approval to work from home, although arrangements must suit
the type of work performed and operational requirements.
Christmas Closedown
All departmental workplaces will be closed from 12:30 pm on the last working day before
Christmas Day and reopen the first working day following the first day of January. This
period will be known as the Christmas Closedown.
Employees are not required to attend for duty during the Christmas Closedown, unless
otherwise directed by the Secretary, and will be paid in accordance with their ordinary hours
of work. Where an employee is absent on leave, payment for the Christmas Closedown will
be in accordance with the entitlement for that form of leave (e.g. if on long service leave at
half pay, payment is on half pay). There will be no deduction from annual or personal leave
credits for the Christmas Closedown.
Where an employee who is eligible for overtime and restriction provisions is directed to
attend work or be available for work during the Christmas Closedown, the overtime rate
applicable to Sunday overtime will apply for the days designated as Christmas Closedown.

23

Part H – Leave
Portability of leave
Where an employee joins the department on an ongoing or non-ongoing basis from an
employer staffed under the PS Act, the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 or from the ACT
Government Service, accrued annual and personal leave (however described) will be
transferred or recognised, provided there is no break in continuity of service, or payments
made to the employee in lieu of these entitlements from the previous employer.
Service with organisations where the employee was previously employed under the PS Act,
the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, or from the ACT Government Service may be
recognised for personal leave purposes if the break in service is not more than two calendar
months.
Impact of leave without pay on personal and annual leave
Where an employee takes 30 or more days leave without pay in total in a calendar year, the
whole period will not count as service for annual and personal leave purposes.
Where an employee takes 30 or more days leave without pay (including an accumulated
period) during the calendar year, the whole period will not count as service.
Cancellation of leave or recall to duty from leave
Where an employee’s leave is cancelled by their manager without reasonable notice, or they
are recalled to work from leave, reasonable travel costs, travelling time, incidental costs and
any other unavoidable costs arising from the recall to duty will be reimbursed where they
are not recoverable under insurance or from another source. All unused leave will be recredited.
Re-crediting periods of approved leave
An employee who becomes eligible for personal, carers or compassionate leave, or any nondiscretionary leave under the National Employment Standards (NES), while on annual or
long service leave may apply to have their annual or long service leave re-credited. Subject
to the provision of satisfactory evidence, the employee’s annual or long service leave will be
re-credited to the extent of the leave subsequently granted.
Workers' compensation
An employee on workers’ compensation leave under the Safety, Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act 1988, whose compensation is calculated on the basis of actual hours
worked, will have their annual and personal leave accrual calculated in the same way.
Annual leave
A full time employee is entitled to four weeks paid annual leave for each completed year of
service, accruing daily.
A part time employee’s annual leave entitlement will accrue on a pro rata basis.
Annual leave credits may be taken at any time with the approval of the manager. Any
unused annual leave accumulates. Annual leave counts as service for all purposes.
An employee may be granted annual leave at half pay. Where an employee takes annual
leave at half pay, the employee cannot access purchased leave in the same calendar year.
Periods of long service leave cannot be broken with annual leave, except as provided for by
legislation.

24

Purchased leave
Employees may purchase up to eight weeks additional annual leave once per 12 month
period by paying for the leave progressively over the course of the relevant period, subject
to the approval of the Secretary.
Purchased leave is intended for use in a planned manner. When considering requests
managers will take into account operational requirements and the reasons for the
employee’s request.
Where an employee has purchased leave approved, they cannot take annual leave at half
pay in the same calendar year.
Unless otherwise agreed, purchased leave not taken during the nominated 12 month period
will automatically be reimbursed as salary.
Purchased leave counts as service for all purposes including superannuation.
Personal leave
Ongoing and non-ongoing full time employees are entitled to 18 paid days personal leave
every 12 months, accrued daily.
A part time employee’s personal leave entitlement will accrue on a pro rata basis.
In the first year of employment, ongoing and non-ongoing employees will be given a credit,
of seven days leave, or part time pro rata equivalent, in advance of accruing the
entitlement. After the date on which the seven days would normally have accrued, accrual
will be on a daily basis.
Existing employees and employees who transfer to the department from another APS
agency will have their accruals adjusted to align with accrual on a daily basis of 18 days paid
cumulative personal leave every 12 months.
Use of personal leave
Personal leave gives employees access to paid leave to be used when they are absent:
a.

due to personal illness or injury including attendance at medical appointments

b.

to provide care or support for a member of the employee’s family who is ill or injured

c.

to provide care or support for a member of the employee’s family or household who is
affected by an unexpected emergency or special circumstance

d.

due to domestic or family violence or

e.

as a result of special or exceptional circumstances.

Personal leave must not be used for the purposes of clauses 191(d) and 191(e) if it would
be detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared to the NES or the APS Award.
A manager may approve personal leave without pay only where paid personal leave credits
are exhausted.
Employees may be granted personal leave at half pay instead of full pay where
extraordinary circumstances exist, as determined by the Secretary.
Personal leave is cumulative but will not be paid out on separation.
Where an employee has exhausted their paid personal leave entitlements they are entitled
to take two days unpaid leave for each occasion where a member of their family or
household requires care because of illness, injury or unexpected emergency. The employee
must provide medical or appropriate documentary evidence to their manager in support of
their leave application.
25

Provision of medical certificates or other evidence
No more than three consecutive days of personal leave may be taken without medical or
other evidence and no more than 12 days in total in a calendar year, unless the Secretary
informs the employee that such evidence will not be required.
Medical certificates from registered medical practitioners will be accepted for the purpose of
personal illness, injury or caring responsibilities. Where it is not reasonably practicable to
provide a medical certificate a statutory declaration made by the employee may be
accepted.
Statutory declarations used as evidence must set out why the employee is or was unable to
attend work, and why it was not reasonably practicable for them to obtain a medical
certificate for the purpose of personal illness, injury or caring responsibilities.
A manager may request that medical or other evidence is provided by the employee for any
period of personal leave. This request should be made at the time the leave is notified or
within a reasonable period of time after the leave is notified.
Where an employee does not provide satisfactory medical or other evidence any personal
leave will be without pay and treated as unauthorised absence.
Where paid personal leave credits are exhausted, the employee must provide medical or
other evidence for any period of unpaid personal leave.
The opinion of a medical practitioner nominated by the department will be accepted over
that of a medical practitioner nominated by an employee, to the extent that their opinions
differ. For further information, employees should consult the Rehabilitation and Return to
Work Policy.
Compassionate leave
An employee is entitled to a period of three days of paid compassionate leave for each
occasion when a member of the employee’s family or household contracts or develops a
personal illness or sustains a personal injury that poses a serious threat to their life, or dies.
An employee may be required to provide reasonable evidence to the Secretary in support of
an application for compassionate leave.
Compassionate leave will count for service for all purposes.
Long service leave
An employee will be eligible for long service leave (LSL) in accordance with the Long Service
Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.
The minimum period for which LSL will be granted is seven calendar days at full pay or 14
calendar days at half pay. A period of LSL cannot be broken by other periods of leave, a
weekend or a public holiday, except as otherwise provided by legislation.
Long service leave credits may be taken at any time, subject to operational requirements
and the approval of the employee’s manager.
Community service leave
An employee is entitled to leave for the purposes of engaging in community service activities
including jury service and emergency management activities as defined in the FW Act.
Participation in voluntary emergency management duties includes training, emergency
service responses, reasonable recovery time and ceremonial duties. The Secretary may
determine whether any or all of the leave taken for participation in voluntary emergency
management activities will be with pay.
Leave with pay will be granted for any period of jury service.
26

An employee will be required to provide the department notice of the absence as soon as
practicable and the period or expected period of absence.
An employee (other than a casual employee) will be reimbursed reasonable expenses
incurred by the employee in excess of the NES entitlement while attending court to serve as
a juror.
Despite clauses 172 and 173, a leave of absence granted under clause 210 will count as
service for all purposes.
Community volunteer leave
Employees may be granted up to two days paid leave each calendar year to volunteer with a
registered community organisation. Employees covered by the Government Lawyer
Broadband may request to use the leave to volunteer legal services.
Paid leave will not be available to attend ceremonial functions unless the organisation
certifies in writing that the employee is required to attend as part of their duties.
Defence reserve leave
An employee may be granted leave (with or without pay) to enable the employee to fulfil
Australian Defence Force (ADF) Reserve and Continuous Full Time Service (CFTS) or Cadet
Force obligations.
An employee is entitled to leave with pay, of up to four weeks during each financial year,
and an additional two weeks paid leave in the first year of ADF Reserve Service, for the
purpose of fulfilling service in the ADF Reserve.
With the exception of the additional two weeks in the first year of service, leave can be
accumulated and taken over a period of two years.
Employees are not required to pay their tax free ADF Reserve salary to the department in
any circumstances.
Defence Reserve leave counts as service for all purposes, except for unpaid leave to
undertake CFTS. Unpaid leave for the purposes of CFTS counts for all purposes except
annual leave accrual.
Eligible employees may also apply for annual leave, long service leave, leave without pay,
top-up pay or they may use flex time or make up time for the purpose of fulfilling ADF
Reserve, CFTS or Cadet Force obligations.
War service sick leave
The Secretary will grant war service sick leave to employees who are unfit for duty because
of a war-caused or defence-caused condition as determined in accordance with relevant
legislation.
Employees who are eligible war veterans will accrue two separate credits of paid war service
sick leave:
a.

Special credit – nine weeks war service sick leave credited on commencement with the
APS following eligible military service.

b.

Annual credit – three weeks annual credit on commencement and again following each 12
months of service. Unused credits accumulate up to a maximum credit balance of nine
weeks. This credit cannot be accessed until the special credit has been exhausted.

Employees who re-join the APS following an earlier period of APS employment in which they
had been credited with war service sick leave will be credited with:
a.

any special credit that remained unused at the final day of the prior APS employment and

b.

any annual credit held on the final day of the prior APS employment.
27

Miscellaneous leave
Miscellaneous leave provides flexibility to managers and employees. Miscellaneous leave
may be granted for circumstances not provided for elsewhere in this Determination, either
with or without pay, for a purpose that the Secretary considers to be in the interests of the
department and having regard to operational requirements.
The leave granted may be for the period requested or for another period, and to count as
service or not to count as service. Where miscellaneous leave is refused the manager will
advise the employee (if requested) in writing of the reason for the decision to refuse leave.
Employees will be granted miscellaneous leave without pay where, due to an increase in
their working hours, they have not accrued the equivalent of four weeks annual leave based
on their current working hours. The maximum amount of leave provided will be the
difference between the amount of leave accrued over the year and 20 days at their current
working hours. This will count as service for all purposes except long service leave, unless
the Secretary determines otherwise.
Employees may be granted up to two days paid cultural leave in a calendar year for religious
or cultural activities associated with their culture or ethnicity.
Employees may access one additional day paid cultural leave to participate in NAIDOC.
Ceremonial leave
Managers may grant up to 20 days in any two calendar years of leave without pay to
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees for ceremonial purposes arising from the
death of a family member or other ceremonial obligations. Leave for a ceremonial obligation
is without pay and does not count as service.
Ceremonial leave is in addition to compassionate leave.
Parental leave
For the purpose of this Determination, parental leave includes: maternity and maternal
leave, primary carer leave, adoption leave, long term foster care and permanent care
orders, supporting partner leave and unpaid parental leave.
All parental leave types must be taken in a single, unbroken period, unless otherwise
provided for under legislation or this Determination.
All paid parental leave types will count as service for all purposes. For employees without
the qualifying service period for paid maternity leave under the Maternity Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 (Maternity Leave Act), up to 12 weeks of unpaid
maternity, adoption or long term foster care and permanent care orders leave will count for
service. Unpaid parental leave types will not count as service unless otherwise provided for
under legislation. Unpaid parental leave will not be taken to have broken service.
To provide for flexible administration, employees have the option to spread the payment for
all paid parental leave types up to double the number of weeks at a rate of one-half of the
normal salary for the employee. When payment is spread at half pay, only the full pay
equivalent period will count as service (except to the extent this clause contradicts clause
236).
Maternity and maternal leave

Hours Policy.

30

Part I – Management of excess employees
The following provisions apply to all employees covered by this Determination, excluding an
employee serving a probationary period and a non-ongoing employee.
The department will, as far as possible, avoid involuntary redundancies. Reasonable steps
will be taken to facilitate redeployment opportunities at level across the department and the
APS for excess or potentially excess employees.
An offer of voluntary redundancy to an employee who is not fit for and not at work may be
made to an employee who is excess in accordance with the paragraph below only where the
Secretary, having regard to the Commonwealth’s liability, decides it is appropriate.
Discussion and consideration period
Where an excess employee situation is identified, the Secretary will:
a.

advise the employee(s) directly affected of the situation, the reasons and scope and
invite the employee(s) to nominate a representative

b.

discuss the voluntary redundancy and reassignment processes with affected employees

c.

hold discussions with the employee(s) and their nominated representatives and

d.

offer the affected employee(s) voluntary redundancy.

The employee(s) will have two months in which to consider the offer of voluntary
redundancy. An employee who has received an offer of voluntary redundancy must advise
the Secretary, in writing, before the end of the discussion and consideration period whether
they wish to be considered for re-assignment or voluntary redundancy.
Employees will become excess one month after being made an offer of voluntary
redundancy, unless during this time their employment has been terminated, they have been
redeployed or the Secretary decides they are no longer in an excess situation.
If the employee does not respond, the employee will be taken to have a preference to be
considered for reassignment, and their retention period will commence in accordance with
clause 279.
Voluntary redundancy offer
The offer must state when the Secretary proposes to issue the termination notice if the offer
is accepted.
The offer should include the following information to assist the employee in their
considerations:


amount payable as redundancy pay, pay in lieu of notice and accrued annual and long
service leave credits



superannuation entitlements upon voluntary redundancy



superannuation options



taxation rules applicable to the various payments



the availability of financial assistance, on a reimbursement basis, towards obtaining
independent financial advice up to the value of $1,200.

Should the employee request and receive an earlier termination date that falls within the
discussion and consideration period, the employee will be entitled to receive payment for the
unexpired portion of the discussion and consideration period.

31

Career transition assistance
At the time the employee is offered a voluntary redundancy or as soon as possible thereafter
but no later than two weeks after the voluntary redundancy offer, potentially excess
employee(s) will be offered career transition assistance which will include:
a.

advice on the re-assignment and redundancy process

b.

a point of contact for individual queries

c.

assistance with identifying re-assignment opportunities and/or

d.

training/redeployment assistance.

Employees may also access the department’s Employee Assistance Program for free
personal counselling.
Voluntary redundancy process
If an employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy, and the Secretary agrees to the
redundancy, the Secretary will issue a ‘notice of termination’ under section 29 of the PS Act.
The period of notice will be four weeks, or five weeks for an employee over 45 years of age
with at least five years of continuous, current APS service at the time of the offer. Where an
employee elects to terminate their employment before the expiration of the notice period,
payment in lieu for the unexpired portion of the notice period will be made.
Notice of termination will not be given before the end of the discussion and consideration
period without the agreement of the employee.
Only one offer of voluntary redundancy will be made to an employee.
Job exchanges will be available until the end of the discussion and consideration periods. A
job exchange is where a departmental employee who has been offered voluntary
redundancy but does not want one, swaps jobs with an employee from within the
Department or from another agency who is not excess but who wants voluntary redundancy.
Job exchanges are subject to the Secretary’s approval on a case by case basis.
An employee will not be made involuntarily redundant if the employee has not been offered
a voluntary redundancy, or has requested, but not received an offer of voluntary
redundancy.
Severance pay
An employee who accepts voluntary redundancy and whose employment is terminated
under section 29 of the PS Act on the grounds that they are excess to requirements will be
entitled to the following severance pay, subject to any minimum amount the employee is
entitled to under the NES:
a.

two weeks of salary for each completed continuous year of service and

b.

a pro rata payment for completed continuous months of service since the last completed
year of service.

The minimum amount of severance pay is an amount equal to four weeks’ salary and the
maximum amount payable is an amount equal to 48 weeks’ salary.
Severance pay is calculated on a pro rata basis for any period of service when the employee
worked part time, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the
NES.
For an excess employee, salary includes:
a.

the employee’s substantive salary on the date of termination and

32

b.

temporary performance loading where the employee has received the loading for a
continuous period of at least 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the
employee is given a formal offer of a voluntary redundancy and

c.

allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of annual leave and on a
regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement for expenses incurred, or
a payment for disabilities associated with the performance of duty.

Service for severance pay purposes
Service for severance pay purposes means:
a.

service in the department

b.

Government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth
Employees) Act 1976

c.

service with a Commonwealth body (other than service with a Joint Commonwealth-State
body corporate in which the Commonwealth does not have a controlling interest) which is
recognised for long service leave purposes

d.

service with the Australian Defence Forces

e.

APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under repealed section 49 of the
Public Service Act 1922, if the service has not previously been recognised for severance
pay purposes

f.

service in another organisation where an employee was transferred from that
organisation with a transfer of function; or an employee engaged by that organisation on
work within a function is appointed as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS
and such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.

For earlier periods of service to count, there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where:
a.

the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of employment
with the new employer was made and accepted by the employee before ceasing
employment with the preceding employer or

b.

the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee was
deemed to have resigned from the APS under the repealed section 49 of the Public
Service Act 1922.

Service not to count for severance pay purposes
Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes are previous
periods of service that ceased by way of:
a.

termination under section 29 of the PS Act or

b.

prior to the commencement of the PS Act, by way of redundancy; forfeiture of office,
retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or loss of qualifications; dismissal or
termination of probationary appointment for reasons of unsatisfactory service or

c.

voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the employee
or

d.

payment of a redundancy benefit or a similar payment or an employer-financed
retirement benefit.

Absences from duty which do not count as service for long service leave purposes will not
count for severance pay purposes.

33

Retention period
Should an employee not accept the formal offer of voluntary redundancy, the employee will
commence their retention period one month after the offer of voluntary redundancy. The
notice period will be concurrent with the retention period.
The purpose of the retention period is to enable excess employees to be reassigned within
the APS or to find other suitable employment. Consistent with this, during the retention
period:
a.

the department will continue to provide and resource reasonable career transition
services and support, and take all reasonable steps to move an excess employee to a
suitable vacancy, to another agency or to pursue placements outside the APS consistent
with this Determination and

b.

employees will take all reasonable steps to secure permanent re-assignment or
placement.

The retention period is:
a.

13 months where an employee has 20 or more years of continuous, current service with
the APS or is over 45 years of age

b.

seven months for other employees.

If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, their retention period is
reduced by the employee’s redundancy pay entitlement under the NES on termination,
calculated as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this clause).
Redeployment
The following provisions will apply to employees during their retention period:
a.

The employee can access up to $1,200 for payment for outplacement services or training
opportunities that would be expected to enhance the employment prospects of
employees.

b.

Excess employees of the department will be considered first and in isolation from, and
not in competition with, other applicants who are not excess for an advertised vacancy to
which the employee seeks transfer but only at or below the employee’s level. In placing
excess employees, consideration will be given to the employee’s current skills and
experience or the employee’s ability to acquire the relevant skills for the advertised
vacancy in a short period of time.

c.

Suitable trial placements in other organisations, including private sector organisations,
will be funded for up to three months where there is an identifiable opportunity for
permanent placement and no job swap arrangement is involved. An individual employee
may undertake more than one trial placement.

d.

The employee will be entitled to reasonable paid leave for the purpose of attending
employment interviews and may request assistance in meeting reasonable travel costs
and incidental expenses incurred by the employee in seeking alternative employment,
where these are not met by the prospective employer.

e.

The employee may, after being given four weeks of notice (or five weeks for employees
over 45 years old who have completed at least five years of continuous, current APS
service), be reduced in classification as a means of securing alternative employment. If
reduction occurs after the offer of voluntary redundancy and before the end of the
retention period the employee will receive payments to maintain the employee’s salary
level for the balance of the retention period.

34

Extension of the retention period
Retention periods will only be extended by periods of approved leave due to the employee’s
illness or injury (supported by medical evidence) taken during the retention period. The
period will not be extended on these grounds beyond an additional eight weeks.
Involuntary redundancy
If an excess employee is unsuccessful in obtaining permanent reassignment at the end of
the retention period, the employee’s employment will be terminated under section 29 of the
PS Act. An employee may be entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES.
Where an excess employee’s employment is to be terminated the employee will be given
four weeks’ notice of termination (or five weeks for an employee over 45 years of age with
at least five years of continuous, current APS service). This period of notice will be served,
as far as practicable, concurrently with the retention period.

35

Part J – Separation
Resignation
An employee, where practicable, is requested to give the Secretary at least two weeks’
notice in writing of their intention to resign or retire (except where the employee has less
than one year of continuous service, in which case the employee is required to give one
weeks' notice). Where an employee submits a resignation which takes effect on a public
holiday, the resignation will be deemed effective from close of business on the working day
immediately prior to the public holiday. All resignations will be deemed to take effect at
close of business of the resignation date.
Any outstanding payments for purchased leave or any flex debt will be deducted from a
person’s final monies if they cease to work for the department.
Payment on death
Where an employee dies, or the Secretary directs that an employee will be presumed to
have died on a particular date, the Secretary may authorise the payment of an amount that
would have been paid if the employee had otherwise ceased employment either by
resignation or age retirement on that day.
Payment will be made to dependants or the partner of the former employee or the former
employee’s legal personal representative.

36

Part K – Dispute resolution
These provisions set out the procedures to settle disputes relating to:
a.

a matter arising under this Determination; or

b.

the NES.

An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the purposes of
the procedures of these provisions.
In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level, by discussions between the employee or employees and the relevant
supervisors and/or management.
If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may
refer the matter to the Fair Work Commission (FWC).
The FWC may deal with the dispute in two stages:
a.

the FWC will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate, including by
mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a recommendation and

b.

if the FWC is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the FWC may then:


arbitrate the dispute and



make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Note: If the FWC arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available to it
under the FW Act. A decision that the FWC makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for
the purpose of Div 3 of Part 5.1 of the FW Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made against
the decision.
While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this term:
a.

an employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally unless they
have a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety

b.

an employee must comply with a direction given by the Secretary to perform other
available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:


the work is not safe or



applicable work health and safety legislation would not permit the work to be
performed or



the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform or



there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply with the
direction.

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the FWC in accordance
with these provisions.

7:00 am–7:00 pm Monday to Friday and/or include Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays
for an ongoing or fixed period.
Shift penalty payments will not be taken into account in the computation of overtime or in
the calculation of any allowance based upon salary, nor will they be paid with respect to any
shift for which any other form of penalty payment is made under this Determination. An
employee's ordinary rate will include any Temporary Performance Loading for the shift.
Shiftworkers will receive the following rate:

between 7:00 pm and 7:00 am
Work performed anytime on a Saturday

130% of ordinary
hourly rate

Work performed anytime on a Sunday
Work performed anytime on a public holiday

150% of ordinary
hourly rate

they will be paid crib time of single time for the period they are required to be on standby.

43

Operation of shifts
Managers will allocate shifts equitably among employees undertaking shift work, with shift
rosters specifying the standard hours of work for each shift.
A shift worker can be moved from one shift team to another by agreement at any time or
with seven days’ notice. If seven days’ notice has not been given, except where this is not
possible due to the illness or unanticipated absence of another employee, overtime will apply
as per the overtime provisions of this Determination for work outside the employee’s
previously rostered hours of duty until the employee has received seven days’ notice of the
shift change.
Shiftworkers can exchange shifts or rostered days off by mutual agreement and with the
approval of the relevant manager provided that the arrangement does not give rise to an
employee working overtime.
Leave
Shiftworkers will accrue an additional half day of paid annual leave for each Sunday or public
holiday worked, up to a maximum of five days for each calendar year in addition to penalty
rates.
If the employee is rostered off on a public holiday, they will if practicable, within one month
of that public holiday, be granted a day’s paid leave in lieu of that holiday. Where it is
impractical to grant a day’s leave in lieu, the employee will be paid one day’s pay at ordinary
time.
Where a shiftworker takes annual leave, they will be paid shift penalty payments in respect
of any duty which the shiftworker would have performed had they not been on approved
annual leave.
Where a shiftworker takes a period of leave other than annual leave, shift penalties are not
