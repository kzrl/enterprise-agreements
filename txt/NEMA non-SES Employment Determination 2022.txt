SECTION 2 – CONSULTATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Major Change
3.

Clauses 3 to 12 apply if:
•

the Agency has made a definite decision to introduce a major change to
production, program, organisation, structure, or technology in relation to its
enterprise; and

•

the change is likely to have a significant effect on employees of the Agency.
1

4.

The Agency will notify the relevant employees of the decision to introduce the major
change.

5.

The relevant employees may appoint a representative for the purposes of the
procedures in clauses 3 to 12. If:

6.

7.

•

a relevant employee appoints, or relevant employees appoint, a representative
for the purposes of consultation; and

•

the employee or employees advise the Agency of the identity of the
representative, the Agency will recognise the representative.

As soon as practicable after making its decision, the Agency will discuss with the
relevant employees:
•

the introduction of the change;

•

the effect the change is likely to have on the employees; and

•

measures the Agency is taking to avert or mitigate any adverse effect of the
change on the employees.

For the purposes of the discussion the Agency will provide, in writing, to the relevant
employees:
•

all relevant information about the change including the nature of the change
proposed;

•

information about the expected effects of the change on the employees; and

•

any other matters likely to affect the employees.

8.

The Agency is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information
to the relevant employees.

9.

organisation, structure or technology in relation to the Agency, the requirements set
out in clauses 4 to 7 are taken not to apply.

11.

For the purposes of clauses 3 to 10, a major change is likely to have a significant effect
on employees if it results in:
•

the termination of the employment of employees;

•

major change to the composition, operation or size of the Agency’s workforce or
to the skills required of employees;

•

the elimination or diminution of job opportunities (including opportunities for
promotion or tenure);

•

the alteration of hours of work;

•

the need to retrain employees;
2

12.

•

the need to relocate employees to another workplace; or

•

the restructuring of jobs.

For the purposes of clauses 3 to 11, relevant employees means the employees who may
be affected by the major change.

Change to regular roster or ordinary hours of work
13.

Where the Agency proposes to introduce a change to the regular roster or ordinary
hours of work of employees the Agency must notify the relevant employees of the
proposed change and clauses 13 to 18 apply. The relevant employees may appoint a
representative for the purposes of the procedures in clauses 13 to 18. If:
•

a relevant employee appoints, or relevant employees appoint, a representative for
the purposes of consultation; and

•

the employee or employees advise the Agency of the identity of the representative,
the Agency will recognise the representative.

14.

As soon as practicable after proposing to introduce the change, the Agency will discuss
the introduction of the change with the relevant employees.

15.

For the purposes of the discussion, the Agency will provide to the relevant employees:
•

all relevant information about the change including the nature of the change
proposed;

•

information about what the Agency reasonably believes will be the effects of the
change on the employees; and

•

information about any other matter that the Agency reasonably believes is likely
to affect the employees.

16.

As soon as practicable after proposing to introduce the change, the Agency will invite
the relevant employees to give their views about the impact of the change (including
any impact in relation to their family or caring responsibilities).

17.

The Agency is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information
to the relevant employees.

18.

The Agency will give prompt and genuine consideration to the matters raised about the
change by the relevant employees.

19.

For the purposes of clauses 13 to 18, relevant employees means the employees who
may be affected by the change referred to in clause 13.

Dispute resolution
20.

If a dispute relates to:
•

a matter arising under this Determination; or

•

the National Employment Standards,
clauses 21 to 27 set out procedures to settle the dispute.
3

21.

The Agency or an employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint another person,
organisation or association to accompany and/or represent them for the purposes of
clauses 20 to 27.

22.

In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level through discussions between the employee or employees and relevant
supervisors and/or management.

23.

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute
may refer the matter to the Fair Work Commission (FWC).

24.

The FWC may deal with the dispute in two (2) stages:
•

the FWC will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate,
including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a
recommendation; and

•

if the FWC is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the FWC may then:

-

arbitrate the dispute; and

-

make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Note: If the FWC arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available
to it under the Fair Work Act 2009.
25.

A decision that the FWC makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for the purpose
of Division 3 of Part 5.1 of the Fair Work Act 2009. Therefore, an appeal may be made
against the decision.

26.

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in clauses 21 to
27:

27.

•

an employee will continue to perform their work as they would normally unless
they have a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety;
and

•

an employee will comply with a direction given by the employer to perform other
available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
-

the work is not safe;

-

applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the
work to be performed;

-

the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or

-

there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the FWC in
accordance with clauses 20 to 27.

Leave of absence to attend proceedings
28.

Where the provisions of clause 22 and 23 have been complied with, and to assist in the
resolution of the matter, an employee who is appointed to accompany or represent
4

another employee pursuant to clause 21 will be granted leave of absence to attend FWC
proceedings arising from a referral of a dispute in accordance with clause 23 and will
not suffer any loss of pay in respect of the absence.
Leave of absence to attend courses
29.

To assist in the resolution of disputes in the Agency, an employee representative
(as defined in clause 21), will be granted leave of absence to attend short courses
conducted by a recognised training provider which are specifically directed towards
effective dispute resolution. The grant of leave will be subject to the operating
requirements of the Agency.

30.

The specific training course will be agreed between the employer and the individual
employee.

31.

An employee representative granted leave of absence under clause 29 will not suffer
any loss of pay.

5

SECTION 3 – PERFORMANCE AND CAPABILITY
Performance Management
32.

The performance management process provides employees, supervisors and their
managers, the opportunity to discuss and agree to key job responsibilities and
deliverables, and to identify development requirements to perform their duties or for
their own career development. All employees are required to participate in the
performance management and development process.

33.

The performance management process within the Agency will be based on the principles
of equity, transparency, natural justice and procedural fairness and will be aimed at
supporting and improving performance.

34.

If an employee’s performance is not effective they will be supported to improve their
performance. Employees may elect to be represented in relation to an employee’s
performance.

Capability development
35.

Employees and their managers are jointly responsible for identifying capability needs
and opportunities that meet the personal development needs of the individual and the
operational/business needs of the Agency.

Assistance for employees undertaking study
36.

Employees who undertake accredited study relevant to the work of the Agency and/or
the broader APS may be eligible for:
•

•

reimbursement of up to $3,000 per financial year for approved course fees on
successful completion of the approved course work; and/or
paid study leave of up to six (6) hours per week.

6

SECTION 4 – HOURS OF WORK AND FLEXIBLE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS
Flexible working arrangements
37. Employees may request flexible working arrangements such as compressed hours, working from
home, part-time, or job sharing to enable them to balance their work and personal lives.
38. The Agency is committed to supporting and promoting flexible working arrangements. The
Agency Head will consider requests for flexible working arrangements in the context of the
employee's personal circumstances, operational requirements, providing fair workloads, and
with the understanding that the employee's performance should be assessed on the outcomes
that are achieved not how many hours are worked or where.
39. Without limiting an employee’s ability to request flexible working arrangements under clauses
37 and 38, where certain circumstances outlined in the National Employment Standards apply
to an employee, that employee can formally request flexible working arrangements because of
those circumstances. More details are available in Division 4 of Part 2-2 of the Fair Work Act
2009.
40. Where the Agency Head approves an employee to work from home, or other flexible work
arrangement, the Agency will meet reasonable costs of supplying and maintaining the agreed
necessary equipment and materials.
Hours of work – non-shift workers
41. Full-time employees are required to work 7 hours and 36 minutes per day, being a total of 38
hours per week and 152 hours per four week settlement period. This time is made up of:
a.

ordinary hours of work of 7 hours and 21 minutes per day, being a total of 36 hours
and 45 minutes per week and 147 hours per four week settlement period; and

b.

an additional 15 minutes per day, being a total of 75 additional minutes per week or
5 additional hours per settlement period. The employee's salary rate includes
payment for this additional time, including any overtime payable under the APS
Award. The additional time is treated as part of an employee's ordinary hours for
all purposes under this Determination.

42. The default span of hours (bandwidth) during which an employee may work their ordinary hours
is 8.00 am to 6.00 pm, Monday to Friday.
43. If the Agency Head agrees that an employee can perform part of their ordinary hours between
7.00 am and 8.00 am or 6.00 pm and 7.00 pm on a day, the employee's salary rate includes
payment for the performance of work during those periods, including any overtime or shift
penalties payable under the APS Award. The time worked in that period will be treated as part
of the employee's ordinary hours of work for all purposes under the Determination.
44. An employee’s ordinary hours are those hours and time, within the agreed bandwidth, that the
employee works on a regular basis, as agreed by the employee’s manager.
45. Standard attendance hours for full-time employees are 7 hours and 36 minutes from 8.30 am
to 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm to 5.06 pm, Monday to Friday. Standard attendance hours will apply:
•

if an employee and their manager cannot agree on a pattern of hours; or

•

if an employee’s manager reasonably considers that the employee’s attendance is
unsatisfactory.
7

Hours of work – shift workers
46. Shift workers are required to work ordinary hours of 7 hours and 36 minutes per day, being a
total of 38 hours per week and 152 hours per four week settlement period averaged over a
period of up to 28 days or the employee's roster cycle (whichever is longer). The ordinary hours
must be worked continuously except for breaks.
47. Except at regular changeover of shifts, an employee must not be required to work more than
one shift in each 24 hours.
48. Shift rosters must specify the commencing and finishing times of ordinary working hours of the
respective shifts.
49. Shift workers can exchange shifts or rostered days off by mutual agreement, with the consent
of the Agency Head, and provided that the arrangement does not give any employee an
entitlement to an overtime payment.
50. Subject to the provisions of clause 13 to 18, changes to rostered hours of duty can be by mutual
consent at any time or by amendment of the roster on seven days’ notice.
51. In the absence of consent or seven days’ notice, employees will be paid the appropriate overtime
penalty rates for work outside the previously rostered hours of duty. Payment of penalty rates
on this basis will be continued for each changed shift until employees have received seven days’
notice of shift change.
52. The penalty rates in clause 69 are not payable where an agency is unable to give seven days’
notice because of the sickness or unanticipated absence of another employee.
53. Where employees are entitled to a rostered day off, an employee and their manager may agree
to alternative rostered days (including taking the time off as part days).
General provisions
54. An employee at or below the APS 6 level or equivalent must record their attendance in the
Agency’s timekeeping system.
55. Employees will not be required to work for more than ten (10) ordinary hours on any one (1)
day, subject to arrangements being made for shift workers to work more than 10 hours per day
in a manner consistent with the APS Award.
56. Employees will not be required to work more than five (5) consecutive hours without taking a
break of at least 30 minutes.
57. The Agency Head will arrange for the provision of a meal or reimburse the employee for the cost
of a meal where no meal is provided in the following instances:
a.

where an employee who is entitled to receive overtime payments and who works
overtime after the end of ordinary work for the day, to the completion of or beyond
a meal period, without a break for a meal;

b.

where an employee is required, after the completion of their ordinary hours of work
for the day, to perform duty after a break for a meal which occurs after that
completion and is not entitled to payment for that break;

c.

where an employee is required to perform duty before the commencement of
ordinary hours of work, who breaks for a meal and is not entitled to payment for
that break; or
8

d.

where an employee is required to perform work on a Saturday, Sunday or Public
Holiday, in addition to the employee’s normal weekly hours of work, extending
beyond a meal break and is not entitled to payment for that meal break.

58. Employees will be entitled to an eight (8) hour break plus reasonable travelling time before
commencing work again. Where the Agency Head directs an employee to work outside their
agreed bandwidth hours, and if the eight (8) hour break occurs during standard working hours,
the employee will receive their normal salary during that period. Where the Agency Head directs
an employee to work outside their agreed bandwidth hours and an eight (8) hour break is not
possible due to operational requirements, the employee will be paid for subsequent periods of
work at the overtime rate of double time until the employee has taken an eight (8) hour break.
APS level employees – flex time – non-shift workers
59. Employees at or below the APS 6 level or equivalent, including part-time employees, can access
flex time.
60. When an employee works more than their standard hours within the bandwidth, they will
accumulate a flex credit, and when an employee works less than their standard hours within the
bandwidth, they will incur a flex debit.
61. Flex will be credited or debited on a one-for-one basis (i.e. one (1) hour worked in addition to
the employee’s ordinary hours will result in one (1) hour of flex credit).
62. An employee may carry a maximum flex debit of one day and a maximum flex credit of three
days (based on the employee's ordinary hours of work) into the next settlement period. A
settlement period is a four (4) week period.
63. An APS level employee who is required at the request of the Agency Head to undertake duties
outside of the bandwidth will be eligible to receive overtime in accordance with clauses 64 to 77.
Overtime
64. An employee may be called for duty at any time subject to the hours being considered to be
reasonable in accordance with section 62 of the Fair Work Act 2009. In accordance with section
62 of the Fair Work Act 2009, an employee may refuse to work additional hours if they are
unreasonable. Overtime is to be worked by prior direction or, if circumstances do not permit
prior direction, subsequent approval in writing.
Overtime – non shift workers
65. A full-time APS level employee will be entitled to overtime if the employee is directed to perform
work:
a.

Monday to Friday, outside the bandwidth;

b.

Monday to Friday, during the bandwidth but beyond the length of time the employee
is ordinarily required to work on the day concerned; or

c.

on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday.

66. A part-time APS level employee will be entitled to overtime if the employee is directed to perform
work:
a.

which is not continuous with the employee's ordinary hours of work;

9

b.

which is continuous with an employee's ordinary hours of work, and in whole or in
part, falls outside the period 6.00 pm to 8.00 pm, where the employee also
completes the ordinary hours of duty on that day;

c.

which is continuous with an employee's ordinary hours of work, and falls wholly
within the period 6.00 pm to 8.00 am and exceeds, in any one week, that employee's
prescribed weekly ordinary hours of work.

67. A casual APS level employee will be entitled to overtime, but not casual loading, if the casual
employee is directed to perform work:
a.

on Monday to Friday, outside the bandwidth;

b.

on a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday; or

c.

in excess of 36.75 hours in a week.

68. Overtime will include payment for reasonable travelling time to and from work where the
overtime is not continuous with an employee’s ordinary duty. Overtime is not paid for other
periods of travel, including official travel for business purposes.
69. Overtime will be paid on the following basis:

Overtime – shift workers
70. Full time APS level shift workers will be entitled to overtime when their work:
a.

is performed on any day which is outside the normal rostered ordinary hours of duty
on that day; or

b.

is performed in excess of the weekly hours of ordinary duty, or an average of the
weekly hours of ordinary duty over a cycle of shifts.

71. Part time APS level shift workers will be entitled to overtime when their work:
a.

is performed on any day beyond the normal rostered hours of duty on that day; and

b.

is performed in excess of the employee's prescribed weekly ordinary hours.

72. Casual APS level shift worker will be entitled to overtime where their work is performed:
a.

on any day beyond the normal rostered hours of duty on that day; or

10

b.

in excess of 38 hours in a week or an average of 38 hours per week over a cycle of
shifts.

73. Where a shift worker works overtime, they are entitled to the following overtime rates:

150%

Monday to Friday – after 3 hours

200%

Saturday and Sunday – all day

200%

Public Holiday or Additional Holiday – all
day

250%

74. Where an casual shift worker employee works overtime the Agency must pay to the employee
the higher of:
a.

the overtime rate outlined at clause 73.

b.

the irregular or intermittent penalty rate outlined at clause 94.

75. The emergency duty provisions outlined in this Determination will not apply to shift worker
employees whose work for the day is varied by alteration of the commencement of the schedules
shift to meet an emergency.
76. Overtime will include payment for reasonable travelling time to and from work where the
overtime is not continuous with an employee’s ordinary duty. Overtime is not paid for other
periods of travel, including official travel for business purposes.
Minimum overpayment payments
77. For the purposes of the overtime provisions:
a.

subject to clauses 77b and 77c, where an eligible employee works less than one
hour of overtime a minimum payment of one hour will be made. After the first hour,
if less than a whole hour is worked, payment will be calculated at the nearest hour;

b.

a minimum payment of four (4) hours will apply when the employee is required to
return to work after leaving their place of work;

c.

if employees are undertaking an emergency duty or a restriction duty, then they are
entitled to the minimum payments set out in clauses 98 and 108;

d.

where more than one attendance is involved, the minimum overtime payment
provision will not operate to increase an employee’s overtime remuneration beyond
the amount which would have been received had the employee remained on duty
from the commencing time of duty on one attendance to the ceasing time of duty
on a following attendance; and

e.

where an overtime attendance, not continuous with ordinary hours of work, involves
duty both before and after midnight, the minimum payment provisions of this
subclause will be satisfied when the total payment for the whole of the attendance
equals or exceeds the minimum payment applicable to one day. Where a higher
11

overtime rate applies on one of the days, the minimum payment will be calculated
at the higher rate.
Absence from duty instead of overtime
78. An employee may also reach an agreement with the Agency Head to be granted time off-in lieu
instead of receiving an overtime payment.
79. Where time off in lieu of a payment has been agreed, and the employee has not been granted
that time off within four weeks, or another agreed period, due to operational requirements,
payment of the original entitlement will be made.
80. Where an employee performs a full day’s duty on Sunday, in addition to their prescribed ordinary
hours of work for the week, the employee will, wherever practicable, be granted a day off during
the following week. Where this occurs, an employee who is eligible for the payment of overtime
will be paid an additional one day’s pay in lieu of overtime.
Executive Level employees: time off in lieu (TOIL), flexible hours and overtime
81. Executive Level employees are able to work flexible hours. This means that variations in
attendance times and short-term absences including full days may be agreed in advance with
the Agency Head.
82. To ensure that unreasonable hours are not being worked, the Agency Head should have regular
discussions with Executive Level employees about workload requirements, working hours and
work/life balance.
83. Where an Executive Level employee undertakes significant additional productive effort which
involves working in excess of ordinary hours (which includes working in the office, from home
or travel), the Agency Head and employee may agree arrangements for fair and reasonable time
off in lieu (TOIL) to recognise the additional effort. TOIL should be taken as soon as practicable
after the additional hours are worked, subject to operational requirements. Executive Level
employees are not eligible for overtime payments except in exceptional circumstances as
determined by the Agency Head.
84. As a general rule, time off in lieu should be discussed between a Manager and Executive Level
employee where an employee is required to sustain a working pattern of greater than 8.5 hours
during the normal working week, or works on a weekend, public holiday or closedown, at the
request of the Manager.
Part-time employment and job sharing
85. A part-time employee is someone whose ordinary hours of work are fewer than a full-time
employee's ordinary hours of work. Employees who job share will be classed as part-time. All
part-time and job share working arrangements will be subject to agreement by the employee(s)
and the Agency Head. A formal review to determine the suitability of continuing the part-time
arrangement will be conducted on an annual basis between the employee and the Agency Head.
86. Remuneration and other employment conditions are calculated on a pro-rata basis for part-time
employees. For reimbursable allowances/expenses, part-time employees receive the same
amount as full-time employees.
87. All requests for part-time and job share arrangements will be considered on a case-by-case basis
and in light of operational requirements.

12

88. A part-time employee will normally be required to work at least three hours on their nominated
workdays, unless an alternative period is agreed between the Agency Head and the employee,
and will be continuous on any day.
89. Before part-time duty commences, the Agency Head will issue a notice in writing to the employee
which will specify:
a.

the prescribed weekly hours of duty; and

b.

the pattern of hours to be worked including starting and finishing times for
employees other than shift workers, on each or any day of the week, Monday to
Friday, within the bandwidth.

90. Any variations to the arrangements will be agreed in writing.
91. A part-time employee will revert to full-time employment at the end of the agreed period, unless
the employee renews the part-time arrangement with the approval of the Agency Head.
92. A part-time employee may revert to full-time at any time if the Agency Head agrees and fulltime work is available.
Penalty rates for shift workers
93. Shift penalty payments will not be taken into account when calculating overtime or in calculating
any allowance based on salary. Additionally, in the calculation of penalty rates, an employee's
ordinary salary will be considered to include any higher duties allowances for the shift.
94. A shift worker will be entitled to be paid the following penalty rates for all ordinary hours worked
by the shift worker during the below periods:

for and not cumulative upon the Night or Continuous Night penalty rates.
Part time shift workers
96. Part-time shift workers will be entitled to the Continuous Night penalty rate only where:
a.

the employee's rostered ordinary duty involves working no fewer shifts each week,
or fewer shifts a week on average over the shift cycle than an equivalent full-time
employee; and

b.

the shift worked by a part-time employee is part of a full-time shift and the full-time
shift falls wholly within the hours of 6:00 pm and 8:00 am.

Averaging shift penalties
97. The Agency Head and affected employees may consider a proposal that shift penalties calculated
under clause 94 be averaged over an agreed cycle.
Emergency duty
98. Where an APS level employee is called on duty to meet an emergency at a time when the
employee would not ordinarily have been on duty, and no notice of such call was given to the
employee prior to ceasing ordinary hours of work, the employee will be paid for such emergency
duty at the rate of double time. The time for which payment will be made will include time
necessarily spent in travelling to and from duty. The minimum payment will be two hours at
double time.
99. Clause 98 does not apply to shift workers whose duty for the day is varied by alteration of the
commencement of the scheduled shift to meet an emergency.
Restriction duty
100. An employee may be directed to be contactable and to be available to perform extra duty
outside of the employee's ordinary hours of work, subject to payment under this clause.
101. Payment will be subject to the following conditions:
a.

except with the approval of the Agency Head, an EL level employee will not be
eligible to receive payment;

b.

the restriction situation will be imposed by the prior written direction of the Agency
Head or will be subsequently approved in writing by the Agency Head where the
circumstances did not permit prior direction; and

c.

the provisions regarding Emergency Duty will not apply where an employee is
recalled to duty while restricted.
14

102. Subject to the requirements in clause 101 being met, an employee who is required to remain
contactable and available to perform extra duty outside an employee's ordinary hours of duty
must be paid an allowance at the following rates:
a.

at a rate of 7.5% of the employee’s hourly rate of salary for each hour restricted
Monday to Friday;

b.

at a rate of 10% of the employee’s hourly rate of salary for each hour restricted
Saturday and Sunday; or

c.

at a rate of 15% of the employee’s hourly rate of salary for each hour restricted on
public holidays or additional holidays.

103. An employee’s salary for the purpose of calculation of the allowance under clause 102 must
include higher duties allowance and any other allowances in the nature of salary, being an
allowance applicable to the employee during a period of annual leave.
104. Where approval has been made for payment under clause 101a to an EL Level employee, the
salary will be the pay rate payable to an APS Level 6 employee.
105. The allowance will be payable for each hour or part hour the employee is restricted outside
the employee’s ordinary hours of work.
106. Any part of a period of restriction for which the employee receives another payment will not
be included for calculating payments under clause 102.
107. Where an employee who has been restricted is required to perform duty, but is not required
to be recalled to work, overtime payment will be made, subject to a one hour minimum
payment.
108. Where an employee who has been restricted outside the employee’s ordinary hours of work is
recalled to duty at a place of work, payment in accordance with the relevant overtime
provisions will be made subject to a three hour minimum payment.
109. Notwithstanding these provisions, where an employee is placed in a restriction situation
outside of the employee’s ordinary hours of duty, the employee may be paid at an alternative
rate having regard to the circumstances of the restriction situation.

15

SECTION 5 – LEAVE
Transfer of accrued leave (portability)
110. If an employee joins the Agency (including on promotion or for an agreed period) from an
employer staffed under the Public Service Act 1999, the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 or
from the ACT Government Service, accrued annual leave and personal/carer’s leave credits
will be transferred, based on hours and minutes, provided there is no break in continuity of
service greater than 30 calendar days. This clause also applies to employees transferred to
the Agency as a result of a Machinery of Government change.
111. Any recognised leave excludes any accrued leave paid out on separation from the previous
employer.
112. Use of these accrued leave credits and future entitlements is in accordance with this
Determination.
Leave at half pay
113. When a paid leave entitlement is accessed at half pay (as applicable), half the amount of leave
actually taken at half pay will be deducted from the employee’s leave balance.
Annual leave
114. A full-time employee is entitled to four weeks' paid annual leave for each year of service.
Annual leave:
•

accrues daily;

•

accrues on a pro-rata basis for part-time employees; and

•

counts as service for all purposes.

115. A full time shift worker is also entitled to an additional half a day paid annual leave for each
Sunday rostered, up to a maximum of five days a year. For the purposes of this clause, a
rostered overtime shift of three (3) hours or more which commences or ceases on a Sunday
will count in the calculation.
116. Part-time shift workers are also entitled to an additional half a day paid annual leave where
the employee has a shift pattern involving the regular performance of rostered duty on
Sundays and Public Holidays and involving not less than five shifts per week or an average of
not less than the number of shifts per week of an equivalent full-time employee.
117. An employee may, with approval from the Agency Head (delegate), take some or all of their
annual leave at half pay.
Payment of accrued leave
118. An employee on annual leave will, for the period of the annual leave, be paid at the employee's
ordinary hourly rate.
119. A shift worker on approved annual leave will, for the period of the annual leave, receive shift
penalty payments in relation to any shifts the employee would have worked if the employee
was not on approved annual leave.

16

120. Where employment ceases, the employee will be entitled to payment in lieu of accrued annual
leave. Payment in lieu will be calculated using the employee’s final rate of salary, including
allowances that would have been included during annual leave.
121. Where an employee dies, or the Agency Head has directed that an employee will be presumed
to have died on a particular date, payment may be made to the dependants or partner or the
legal personal representative of the former employee of an amount that would have been paid
if the employee had otherwise ceased employment.
Purchased leave
122. Employees may apply to purchase up to eight (8) weeks’ (40 days) additional leave within a
12 month period.
Christmas closedown
123. The Agency ceases normal operations from the close of business on the last working day
before Christmas Day, recommencing on the first working day after New Year’s Day.

Day and New Year’s Day (without deduction of annual leave) and will be paid in accordance
with their ordinary hours of work.
125. An APS level employee who is required to work on an ordinary working day between Christmas
Day and New Year’s Day will receive payment at the applicable overtime rate for all hours
worked on that day. An Executive Level employee will receive an equivalent period of time off
in lieu.
126. Where, in a cycle of shifts on a regular roster, a shift worker is required to perform rostered
work on each of the days of the week, that employee will, in respect of a holiday which occurs
on a day on which the employee is rostered off work, be granted, if practicable, within one
month after the holiday, a day’s leave in lieu of that holiday.
Volunteer leave
127. Employees may access paid volunteer leave. The Agency's policy on volunteer leave provides
further details. Additional matters regarding volunteer leave are set out in clause 154.
Public holidays
128. Where an employee does not work on a day or part-day identified as a public holiday under
section 115 of the Fair Work Act 2009 they will be entitled to their base rate of pay for the
hours they would have ordinarily worked.
129. An employee’s base location for work purposes is the employee’s normal work location. Where
an employee has been required to work from a different location, the new location will be the
employee’s base location for work purposes.
130. If under a state or territory law, a day or part day is substituted for one (1) of the public
holidays referred to in clause 128, then the substituted day or part day is the public holiday.
131. An employee and the Agency Head may agree to substitute any public holiday referred to in
clause 128 for a cultural or religious day of significance to the employee.
132. Where an employee works both Christmas Day and a substituted holiday, one day will attract
payment at the Public Holiday rate and the other day will be paid at the non-holiday Saturday
or Sunday rate as appropriate.
17

133. An employee may refuse, on reasonable grounds, a request to work on a public holiday.
134. Where an employee is on paid personal/carer’s leave or annual leave at full or half pay on
both sides of the public holiday, payment for the public holiday will be made at the employee’s
full rate of pay.
135. Where a public holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on long service leave
or parental leave there is no entitlement to receive payment as a public holiday. Payment for
that day will be in accordance with the entitlement for that form of leave (e.g. if on long
service leave at half pay, payment is on half pay).
136. Where an employee works on a public holiday or substituted public holiday the minimum
payment payable is four hours.
Long service leave
137. Employees are entitled to long service leave in accordance with the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. The Agency Head will consider applications for long
service leave in light of operational requirements. The Agency Head may approve for an
employee to access a period of long service leave at half pay.
138. The minimum period of absence for which long service leave will be granted is seven (7)
calendar days at full pay or 14 calendar days at half pay. Long service leave may not be
broken by other forms of leave unless otherwise required by legislation.
Personal/Carer's leave
139. Ongoing and non-ongoing employees are entitled to 18 days paid personal/carer's leave for
each year of service with the Agency.
140. Personal/carer’s leave accrues daily and is accrued on a pro-rata basis for part-time employees.
141. An employee is entitled to take personal/carer’s leave where the employee is:
•

ill or injured; or

•

required to provide care or support for members of the employee’s family or
household because of a personal illness or injury of the member or an unexpected
emergency affecting the member.

142. An employee’s accrual of personal/carer’s leave will be reduced proportionately where a period
or cumulative periods of leave without pay that does not count as service exceeds 30 days
within a 12 month period.
143. An employee will provide a medical certificate or, where it is not practical to provide a medical
certificate, a statutory declaration or other supporting evidence acceptable to the Agency Head
in the following circumstances:
•

where the employee is or will be absent on personal/carer’s leave for three (3) or
more consecutive working days, unless the Agency Head informs the employee
that such evidence will not be required;

•

if the employee has been advised by the Agency Head that they are required to
provide evidence for any future personal/carer’s leave absences due to the
employee’s pattern of leave; or

18

•

if the Agency Head has reason to believe that the employee’s absence is not
consistent with the appropriate use of personal/carer’s leave.

144. Employees are entitled to two (2) days’ unpaid carer’s leave in accordance with the Fair Work
Act 2009.
145. An employee cannot take unpaid carer’s leave if the employee could instead take paid
personal/carer’s leave unless approved to so by the Agency Head.

•

a period of miscellaneous leave with pay will count as service for any purpose;

periods of miscellaneous leave without pay which exceed 30 days within a 12
month period will not count as service for any purpose unless required by
legislation; and

•

any periods of miscellaneous leave without pay will count (or not count) as service

Retention period
290. A retention period will commence in relation to an employee who has sought redeployment,
has declined an offer of VR and has been referred to a redeployment program prior to the
offer being made.
291. Where an excess employee has declined an offer of VR the employee will commence a
retention period of seven (7) months. The retention period will commence on the earlier of
the following:
•

the day the employee is formally advised in writing by the Agency Head that they
are an excess employee; or
40

•

30 days after the day on which the Agency Head invites the employee to accept a
VR.

292. If an excess employee is entitled to a redundancy payment in accordance with section 119 of
the Fair Work Act 2009 the retention period in clause 291 is reduced by the number of weeks’
redundancy pay that the employee will be entitled to under the Fair Work Act 2009 on
termination of employment.
293. The retention period and the notice period may be extended by any periods of paid
personal/carer’s leave not exceeding six (6) months, which is supported by medical evidence.
294. During the retention period, the Agency Head:
•

will continue to take reasonable steps to find alternative suitable employment for
the excess employee; and/or

•

may, after giving four (4) weeks’ notice to the excess employee, reduce their
classification as a means of securing alternative employment.

295. If an employee’s classification is reduced during the retention period the employee will
continue to be paid at their previous substantive base salary, immediately prior to the
reduction in classification, for the balance of the retention period.
296. Where the Agency Head believes there is insufficient productive work available for the excess
employee during the retention period, the Agency Head may, with the agreement of the excess
employee, terminate the employee’s employment under section 29 of the Public Service Act
1999 during the retention period on the grounds that they are excess to requirements and
pay the balance of the retention period as a lump sum amount. The lump sum payment will
be taken to include payment in lieu of notice of termination.
297. Upon termination pursuant to clause 298, the employee will be paid a lump sum comprising:
•

the balance of the retention period (as shortened under clause 292) and this
payment will be taken to include the payment in lieu of notice of termination of
employment; and

•

any redundancy payment to which the employee is entitled pursuant to section 119
of the Fair Work Act 2009.

Involuntary Retrenchment (IR)
298. At the end of the retention period the Agency Head may make the excess employee
involuntarily redundant under section 29 of the Public Service Act 1999.
299. An excess employee will not be made involuntarily redundant where:
•

the employee has not been invited to accept an offer of VR;

•

the employee has requested a VR, but the Agency Head has refused; or

•

the employee has not been given four (4) weeks’ notice of termination of
employment (or five (5) weeks for an employee over 45 years of age with at least
five (5) years’ continuous service), or payment in lieu of notice.
