Page 6 of 80

PART 2 – PERFORMANCE AND CAPABILITY
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
2.1

All employees and their managers will participate in the Commission
performance management framework.

2.2

The principles of performance management are:
a) Joint responsibility – employees and supervisors will participate in all
aspects of the performance management process, including initiating
reviews, and seeking and providing feedback as required.
b) No surprises – the performance process will ensure that employees are
aware of how they are performing. Managers should identify and address
performance concerns at the earliest opportunity.
c) Fair – the performance process will provide employees with an opportunity
to respond to performance feedback, consistent with natural justice
principles.
d) Holistic – work outcomes and performance measures will be realistic,
within the employee’s control and consistent with their work level.

2.3

The performance cycle for all employees will run from 1 July each year to 30
June in the following year.

2.4

An employee and their supervisor will develop a performance agreement
within four weeks (or a longer period as agreed) of:
a) the commencement of a new performance cycle; and/or
b) starting in a new position, either temporarily or permanently, at the same
or a higher level, where duties in that position are expected to be
undertaken for at least 3 months.

STUDY ASSISTANCE
2.5

The Commissioner may provide assistance of up to 5 hours study leave per
week (10 hours for employees with a disability or who are Aboriginal and
Page 7 of 80

Torres Strait Islander employees) during semester, 3 hours travel time per
week during semester and $1,500 reimbursement of fees per semester to a
maximum of $3,000 per annum (where study is across more than one
semester) for employees undertaking a course of study that is considered to
be of benefit to the Commission.
SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONALS
2.6

The Commissioner may approve reimbursement for the cost of annual
membership fees of associations up to $750 a year where membership of the
association is essential to enable the employee to undertake their duties.

2.7

The Commissioner may approve reimbursement of up to $42 a year per
employee towards annual membership of other professional associations
relevant to the work of the Commission.

Page 8 of 80

PART 3 – REMUNERATION
SALARY RATES
3.1

The salary rates that will be paid under this Agreement are detailed in
Appendix A of this Agreement.

3.2

All employees with a salary that falls within the salary range for their
classification will receive an increase to their salary with effect from:
a) the date of commencement of the agreement – increase of 2%
b) 12 months after the date of commencement – 2%
c) 24 months after the date of commencement – 2%

3.3

Employees who, on commencement of the Agreement, are in receipt of a
salary above the top of the range increment point for their classification
following the salary increases at Appendix A will not be eligible for the relevant
salary increases. These employees will remain on their current salary and
subject to satisfactory or higher performance in the previous performance
assessment period, will be eligible for:
•

on commencement of the Agreement, a one-off payment of 1% of their
pre-Enterprise Agreement salary;

•

in year two, a one-off payment of 1.5% of their pre-Enterprise Agreement
salary; and

•

in year three, a one-off payment of 0.5% of their pre-Enterprise
Agreement salary.

The timing of these one-off payments will occur at the same time as the increase to
salary rates outlined in clause 3.2. These payments will not count as salary for any
purpose.

3.4

Employees who, on commencement of the Agreement, were in receipt of a
salary above the top of the range increment point for their classification
following the salary increases at Appendix A will transition to the salary
structure when their salary no longer exceeds the top of the range increment
point for their classification. Where an employee on transition to the structure
Page 9 of 80

receives a salary increase less than the value of the one-off payment
available at that time they will receive the one-off payment in addition to the
salary adjustment.
ADJUSTMENT TO FIRST PAY INCREASE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
3.5

In this clause:

(a)

Commencement Date means the date this Agreement commences operation;
and

(b)

Effective Date means the day which is 12 weeks after the date this Agreement
was made in accordance with section 182 of the Fair Work Act 2009.

3.6

Subject to clause 3.5, if the Commencement Date occurs after the Effective
Date, then, in the first available pay period after the Commencement Date, the
Commission will make a salary adjustment payment calculated on the basis
that the salary rates payable under this Agreement on the Commencement
Date applied from the Effective Date.

3.7

The salary adjustment payment at clause 3.6 applies only to salary and does
not apply to any allowance or other payments provided for in this Agreement.

INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBILITY ARRANGEMENTS
3.8

c) the arrangement is genuinely agreed to by the Commissioner and
employee.
3.9

The Commissioner must ensure that the terms of the individual flexibility
arrangement:
a) are about permitted matters under section 172 of the Fair Work Act 2009;
and
b) are not unlawful terms under section 194 of the Fair Work Act 2009; and

a) is in writing; and
b) includes the name of the employer and employee; and
c) is signed by the Commissioner and employee and if the employee is under
18 years of age, signed by a parent or guardian of the employee; and
d) includes details of:
(i)

the terms of the enterprise agreement that will be varied by the
arrangement; and

(ii)

how the arrangement will vary the effect of the terms; and

(iii)

how the employee will be better off overall in relation to the terms
and conditions of their employment as a result of the arrangement;
and

e) states the day on which the arrangement commences and, where
applicable, when the arrangement ceases.
3.11 The Commissioner must give the employee a copy of the individual flexibility
arrangement within 14 days after it is agreed to.

Page 11 of 80

3.12 The Commissioner or employee may terminate the individual flexibility
arrangement:

by giving no more than 28 days written notice to the other party to the
arrangement; or

•

if the Commissioner and employee agree in writing — at any time.

RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS AND OTHER DEBTS
3.13 Salary, salary related and other debts that an employee or former employee
owes to the Commission will be recovered in accordance with the
Commissioner’s Instructions and section 324 of the Fair Work Act 2009.
SALARY ADVANCEMENT
3.14 An on-going employee who is not on the top point of the salary range for the
employee’s base classification or within the same classification in a
Commission Broadbanded Local Title, will be eligible to have their salary
increased by one pay point effective 1 September each year, subject to
meeting the following conditions:
•

the employee has been continuously employed at that classification level
or higher in the Commission for a period of 6 continuous months or more
during the performance cycle; and

•

the employee having an agreed performance agreement in place and
performed at a satisfactory or higher level.

Salary advancement – temporary assignment of duties to a higher
classification
3.15 An employee who is not on the top point of the salary range for the
employee’s temporary classification or within the same classification in a
Commission Broadbanded Local Title and has temporarily performed duties at
a higher level for a continuous period of 12 months as at the end of the
performance cycle, or for a period of 12 months within a 24 month period as at
the end of the performance cycle, will be eligible to have their temporary
salary increased by one pay point at the higher classification level effective 1
September each year, subject to having met the following conditions:

Page 12 of 80

•

the employee has a performance agreement in place; and

•

performed at a satisfactory or higher level.

3.16 If the employee meets the above requirements for salary advancement whilst
on temporary assignment, the rating will be considered to apply equally to the
employee’s base classification.
3.17 Where advancement to a higher pay point has been attained, it is retained for
future periods of temporary performance at the higher classification and on
promotion. This is subject to any break in working at this higher classification
or above, not exceeding 24 months from the date of cessation of the
temporary assignment of duties.
Salary advancement for non-ongoing employees
3.18 A non-ongoing employee who is not at the top of their salary range for the
employee’s classification or within the same classification in a Commission
Broadbanded Local Title will be eligible to have their salary increased by one
pay point effective 1 September each year, subject to the employee having
met the following conditions:
•

has been continuously employed in the Commission at their original
contracted level or higher for a minimum period of 12 months on or before
the end of the performance cycle; and

•

has a performance agreement in place within a minimum of three months
following their commencement and performed at a satisfactory or higher
level.

SALARY ON ENGAGEMENT, PROMOTION AND ASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES
3.19 An employee’s salary on engagement, promotion and assignment of duties
(including movement from another APS Agency) will be at the minimum salary
point for the classification, except where:
a) the Commissioner approves payment at a higher salary point in the
classification’s salary range; or
b) an employee who moves at level from an APS Agency into the
Commission and whose salary exceeds the current maximum salary for
Page 13 of 80

that classification, the Commissioner may maintain their previous
substantive salary until the employee’s salary is at or below the maximum
salary point for the relevant classification level and the employee can be
transferred to a salary pay point within the classification’s salary range.
For the purpose of a) above, the Commissioner may have regard to:
•

previous relevant experience at or above the classification;

•

the employee’s previous salary

•

shortage of required skills in the labour market.

3.20 Where an employee is assigned duties to a lower classification on a
temporary or ongoing basis, the Commissioner may transfer the employee to
any pay point within that range including the top pay point in the lower
classification.
TEMPORARY RE-ASSIGNMENT TO A HIGHER CLASSIFICATION
3.21 The Commissioner may approve payment of a Higher Duties Allowance
(HDA) to an employee who is temporarily assigned to duties at a higher
classification level.
3.22 The minimum period of temporary reassignment that can attract payment of
HDA is two weeks. If the Commissioner determines there are special
circumstances associated with the higher duties, including the requirement to
exercise significant delegated authority, payment may be made for a shorter
period.
3.23 An employee performing all of the duties of a position at a higher classification
may be paid HDA equal to the difference between the employee’s substantive
salary and the base salary of the higher classification unless the
Commissioner approves payment at a higher salary whilst on higher duties
having regard to the employee’s:
•

previous periods of higher duties at or above the proposed higher duties
classification;

•

performance, including during previous periods of higher duties; and

•

relevant experience and/or skills.
Page 14 of 80

3.24 An employee performing part of the duties of a position at a higher
classification, will receive payment at a rate determined by the Commissioner.
SUPERANNUATION
3.25 The Commission will make compulsory employer contributions as required by
the applicable legislation and fund requirements.
3.26 The Commission’s default superannuation fund is the Public Sector
Superannuation Accumulation Plan (PSSap). The Commission will provide
employer superannuation to members of the PSSap of no less than 15.4% of
an employee’s fortnightly contribution salary.
3.27 Where an employee exercises superannuation choice to a fund other than the
PSSap, employer superannuation contributions will be no less than 15.4% of
an employee’s Ordinary Time Earnings as defined in the Superannuation
Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. This will not be reduced by any other
contributions made through salary sacrifice arrangements.
3.28 For employees who take paid and/or unpaid parental leave (which includes
maternity, parental, adoption and foster and permanent care leave), employer
contributions will be made for a period equal to a maximum of 52 weeks as if
the entire period of leave was paid leave or in accordance with the rules of the
appropriate superannuation scheme. Contributions will be based on the
employer contribution amount in the full pay period immediately prior to
commencing leave.
3.29 Employer superannuation contributions will not be paid on behalf of
employees during other periods of unpaid leave not specified in clause 3.28
that do not count as service, unless otherwise required under legislation.
3.30 The Commissioner may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying
superannuation funds that allow employee and/or employer contributions to
be paid through fortnightly electronic funds transfer using a file generated by
the Commission’s payroll system.
3.31 Any fees applied by a chosen fund associated with the administration of
superannuation contributions will be borne by the employee.
Page 15 of 80

3.32 Existing Public Sector Superannuation (PSS) and Commonwealth
Superannuation Scheme (CSS) arrangements will continue in accordance
with the relevant legislation and requirements and based on an employee’s
fortnightly contribution salary.
LOADING FOR CASUAL EMPLOYEES
3.33 Employees engaged on an irregular or intermittent basis (casual employees)
will receive a loading of 20 per cent of salary in lieu of public holidays not
worked and paid leave (except long service leave), which is provided in
accordance with long service leave legislation.
SUPPORTED SALARY RATES
3.34 Supported wage rates (Appendix B) apply to an employee with a disability
who is eligible for consideration under the Supported Wage System.
SALARY PACKAGING
3.35 All ongoing employees and non-ongoing employees with initial contracts of at
least three months, will have access to salary packaging.
3.36 Where an employee takes up the option of salary packaging, the
arrangements will not reduce the employee’s salary for superannuation
purposes or any other purpose.
3.37 The employee will meet the costs of any salary packaging arrangement,
including any fringe benefits tax and administrative costs that the salary
packaging provider may charge.
DEATH OF AN EMPLOYEE
3.38 Where an employee dies, or the Commissioner has directed that an employee
will be presumed to have died on a particular date, payment may be made to
the dependants or partner or legal personal representative of the former
employee of an amount that would have been paid if the employee had
otherwise ceased employment either by resignation or age retirement on that
day.

Page 20 of 80

PART 5 – HOURS OF WORK AND WORKING ARRANGEMENTS
RECORDING HOURS WORKED
5.1

All employees must record and retain an accurate record of their working
hours.

5.2

Periods of leave other than approved flex leave or time off in lieu not
authorised by a leave application may be treated as an unauthorised absence.

5.3

Where an employee is absent from duty without approval, all pay and other
benefits provided under this Agreement, e.g. flextime, will cease to be
available until the employee resumes duty or is granted leave.

5.4

The Commissioner can direct an employee to work standard hours if they fail
to maintain a satisfactory pattern of attendance.

HOURS OF WORK
5.5

The ordinary hours for a full time employee are 7 hours and 30 minutes per
day, a total of 37 hours and 30 minutes per week and 150 hours per four week
settlement period, worked within the bandwidth of 7.00am to 7.00pm Monday
to Friday.

5.6

Standard hours of attendance for employees, other than shift workers, are
8.30am to 12.30pm and 1.30pm to 5.00pm.

5.7

All employees are required to take an unpaid break for at least 30 minutes
after five hours of continuous work.

5.8

No employee can be compelled to work their hours outside the bandwidth
unless as part of a shift work arrangement.

5.9

Unless there are exceptional circumstances, employees will not be required to
work more than 10 hours in any one day.

5.10 Regular hours vary standard hours. An employee, other than a shift worker
will generally perform their regular hours of work within a bandwidth of 7:00am
to 7:00pm Monday to Friday.
Page 21 of 80

be 7 hours and 30 minutes per day or the hours specified in part-time
agreements or shift rosters.
FLEXTIME

•

work flextime;

•

request to work some, or all, of their hours outside of the 7.00am to
7.00pm Monday to Friday bandwidth, subject to operational requirements.
Where an employee requests to work regular hours of duty outside of the
bandwidth for personal reasons, any approved arrangement does not
attract shift work conditions or the payment of overtime.

5.13 The maximum flex credit which can be carried from one settlement period to
another is 37 hours and 30 minutes unless otherwise agreed in writing. The
maximum flex debit which can be carried from one settlement period to
another is 22.5 hours.
5.14 Prior approval and reasonable notice are required for any flex leave of a day
or more, or for part days where predetermined operational requirements
would be affected.
5.15 Employees may use up to five consecutive working days of flex leave.
Reversion to standard hours
5.16 The Commissioner may revert an employee to standard hours of attendance
where an employee fails to appropriately use flextime provisions.
Excess Flex Credits
5.17 Where an employee has a flex balance in excess of 37 hours and 30 minutes,
the Commissioner may, in exceptional circumstances, approve the cash out at
the single hourly rate at the end of the settlement period of the flex credit in
excess of 22.5 hours.

Page 22 of 80

Excess Flex Debit
5.18 The Commissioner may direct an employee who has a negative flex debit of
more than 22.5 hours at the end of a settlement period to treat the debit as
approved miscellaneous leave without pay not to count as service to cancel
the excess debit.
5.19 Where an employee ceasing duty with the Commission has a flex credit, the
amount owing for these credits will be paid to the employee at the single
hourly rate at the date of cessation. Any outstanding debits (also calculated at
the single hourly rate at the date of cessation) will be recovered from the
employee’s separation payment.
EXECUTIVE LEVEL EMPLOYEES – TIME OFF IN LIEU
5.20 The Commission recognises that Executive Level employees because of their
senior work roles and responsibilities will be required from time to time, to
undertake additional hours of work.
5.21 The Commission does not support Executive Level employees working
unreasonable additional hours. Managers and Executive Level employees
should work together to manage workload requirements, working hours and
work/life balance.
5.22 Where an Executive Level employee works additional hours, the
Commissioner may grant access to Time Off In Lieu. In determining Time off
in Lieu arrangements for an Executive Level employee, the Commissioner will
consider the employee’s work and personal circumstances. Time Off in Lieu is
not an hour for hour arrangement.
5.23 Time Off in Lieu should be taken as soon as practical, subject to operational
requirements. Agreed unused Time Off In Lieu up to a maximum amount of 37
hours and 30 minutes can be carried over from month to month.
PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT
5.24 The Commissioner may engage employees on a part-time basis and/or
approve arrangements for an employee to work as a part-time employee. A
full-time employee cannot be compelled to work part-time.

Page 23 of 80

5.25 A part-time employee is one whose hours of duty are less than 37 hours and
30 minutes per week averaged over a four week period.
5.26 Employees returning from maternity, adoption/foster or permanent care leave
have a right to access part-time employment for a period of up to three years.
The proposed pattern of work is subject to agreement of the Commissioner.
HOME BASED WORK (HBW)
5.27 The Commissioner may agree to an employee working from home on a long
term or casual basis. An employee cannot be compelled to work from home.
SHIFTWORK
5.28 The Commissioner may approve shift work arrangements and payments.
5.29 A shiftworker will be paid the following penalty rates for all ordinary hours
worked by the shift worker during the following periods:
Shift
Where any part of a shift falls between 7.00pm and 7.00

Penalty
Rate
15%

am Monday to Friday
Where the shift falls wholly within 7.00pm and 7.00am

30%

Monday to Friday for at least 4 continuous weeks
Where any part of a shift falls between midnight Friday

50%

and midnight Saturday
Where any part of a shift falls between midnight

100%

Saturday and midnight Sunday*
Where any part of a shift falls on a Public Holiday

150%

(except in South Australia, if the public holiday is a
public holiday solely because it is a Sunday)*
*NOTE: In South Australia The Holidays Act 1910 (SA) provides that Sundays are a public
holiday. The public holiday rate will not apply to work undertaken in South Australia if the
public holiday is a public holiday solely because it is a Sunday.

Page 24 of 80

5.30 Shift penalties or shift allowance are payable consistent with long service
legislation, during periods of annual leave and not payable during other
periods of leave. They may count as salary for some superannuation
purposes subject to eligibility provisions in relevant superannuation legislation.
5.31 Where a public holiday occurs on a day when the employee who is regularly
rostered to perform shiftwork on at least six days of the week, is rostered off
duty, the employee is entitled to:
a) leave for a day instead of the public holiday; or
b) an amount equal to salary for a day based on the single hourly rate on that
day for the employee.
This clause will not apply in South Australia if the public holiday is a public
holiday solely because it is a Sunday.
*NOTE: Sundays are a public holiday in South Australia due to the operation of the Holidays
Act 1910 (SA)

5.32 Where a shiftworker works to a roster including weekend days, the employee
will be entitled to an additional half day’s annual leave for each Sunday on
rostered duty up to a maximum of an additional 5 days annual leave.
EXECUTIVE LEVEL EMPLOYEES – OVERTIME AND RELATED PAYMENTS
5.33 Unless approved by the Commissioner in exceptional circumstances,
Executive Level or equivalent employees are not eligible to receive overtime
or other related payments, including emergency duty, restriction duty, and
overtime meal allowance.
OVERTIME
5.34 Overtime is only to be worked with the approval of the Commissioner for work
performed in addition to an employee’s ordinary hours. For part-time
employees, approved overtime would relate to work required to be performed
which is in addition to the employee’s regular hours or is beyond the total
hours of work over the settlement period specified for the employee in the
employee’s part-time agreement.

Page 25 of 80

5.35 Where necessitated by operational requirements, the Commissioner may
approve for an employee to work overtime outside regular hours (as described
in clause 5.10).
5.36 An employee may refuse to work additional hours where such additional hours
are considered to be unreasonable.
5.37 For an employee eligible to receive overtime payments, overtime hours
worked will be paid or, where agreed, time off in lieu of overtime payments will
accrue at the following penalty rates:
•

overtime worked Monday to Saturday will be paid at time and a half for the
first three hours each day and double time thereafter;

•

overtime worked on Sunday will be paid at the rate of double time; and

•

overtime worked on a public holiday will be paid at the rate of double time
and a half, including the single time already paid for the public holiday,
except in South Australia if the public holiday is a public holiday solely
because it is a Sunday.*
*NOTE: Sundays are a public holiday in South Australia due to the operation of the
Holidays Act 1910 (SA).

5.38 Where the Commissioner agrees, employees who are eligible for an overtime
payment for time worked (including overtime payments while on restricted
duty), may elect to take time off in lieu at the applicable penalty rate.
5.39 Where time off in lieu of payment has been agreed, but the employee has not
been granted that time off within four weeks or another agreed period due to
operational requirements, the employee may elect to receive payment of the
original overtime or time worked whilst on restriction duty.
5.40 Salary rates for the purposes of calculating overtime include any allowance in
the nature of salary.
5.41 Where overtime is continuous with ordinary hours, overtime payments will be
made for hours actually worked. There will be no minimum period for which
overtime will be paid. Where overtime is not continuous, payment will include
payment for reasonable travelling time.
Page 26 of 80

EMERGENCY DUTY
5.42 Where the Commissioner approves for an employee to be called for duty to
meet an emergency outside ordinary hours and the employee has received no
notification prior to ceasing ordinary hours of work/duty, the employee will be
paid at the rate of double time for a minimum of two hours, including time
necessarily spent travelling to and from duty.
REST PERIOD
5.43 Where the Commissioner approves an employee to work outside their
ordinary (or regular hours if applicable), the employee will be entitled to an
eight hour break plus reasonable travelling time before commencing work
again, without any loss of pay. Where this is not possible due to operational
requirements, the employee will be paid for subsequent periods of work at
double the hourly rate for the hours worked, until the employee has taken an
eight hour break.
RESTRICTION DUTY
5.44 Where the Commissioner approves for an employee to be contactable and to
be available to perform extra duty outside the bandwidth, for a period(s) of no
less than 12 hours per period unless a reduced period is required and is
approved by the Commissioner, the employee will be paid a Restriction
Allowance at a flat rate of $45 per weekday and $55 for Saturdays, Sundays,
public holidays and closedown days. That is, if an employee is on restriction
for less than one day, they will still receive the daily rate.
5.45 Where an employee in receipt of a Restriction Allowance is recalled to duty at
a place of work, a three hour minimum overtime payment will apply and where
the employee is required to perform duty, but is not recalled to a place of
work, a one hour minimum overtime payment will apply.
5.46 Restriction allowance will continue to be paid for periods of overtime worked
while restricted.
5.47 Restriction Allowance is not payable to an employee while they are on leave.

Page 27 of 80

OVERTIME MEAL ALLOWANCE
5.48 The Commissioner will approve the payment of overtime meal allowance to an
employee who works approved overtime before or after ordinary hours or for a
period not continuous with their ordinary (or regular hours if applicable). This
is on weekends or public holidays, or outside their regular hours. The overtime
worked is to be up to the completion of, or beyond, a meal period specified
below:
•

7.00am to 9.00am

•

noon to 2.00pm

•

6.00pm to 7.00pm

•

midnight to 1.00am.

5.49 Overtime meal allowance will be varied in accordance with rates published by
the relevant subscription service. This allowance does not count as salary for
any purpose.
PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
5.50 Employees will be entitled to the following public holidays each year:
•

1 January (New Year’s Day);

•

26 January (Australia Day);

•

Good Friday;

•

Easter Monday;

•

25 April (Anzac Day);

•

The Queen’s birthday holiday (the day on which it is celebrated in a State
or Territory or a region of a State or Territory);

•

25 December (Christmas Day);

•

26 December (Boxing Day);

•

Any other day, or part-day, declared or prescribed by or under a law of a
State or Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or
a region of the State or Territory, as a public holiday. Other than a day or
Page 28 of 80

part-day, or a kind of day or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work
Regulations 2009 from counting as a public holiday.
5.51 If under a state or territory law, a day or part-day is substituted for one of the
public holidays listed above, then the substituted day or part day is the public
holiday.
5.52 The Commissioner and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day
or part day that would otherwise be a public holiday having regard to
operational requirements.
5.53 An employee, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in the
place where the employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid
for the part or full day absence as if that day or part-day was not a public
holiday, except where that person would not normally have worked on that
day.
5.54 Where a public holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on
leave (other than annual or paid personal/carer’s leave) there is no entitlement
to receive payment as a public holiday. Payment for that day would be in
accordance with the entitlement for that form of leave. Payment for an
employee on long service leave will be in accordance with the applicable
legislation.
5.55 If under a law of a State or Territory every Sunday is declared or prescribed
by or under that law to be a public holiday, there is no entitlement to receive
payment as a public holiday if the employee would have worked, or does
perform work, on that day. In these circumstances, payment will only be made
at the public holiday rate of pay if the employee performs work on that day,
and the Sunday would otherwise be a public holiday under clauses 5.51 and
5.52.
CHRISTMAS AND EASTER CLOSEDOWNS
5.56 The Commission will close its normal operations from 12:30 pm on the last
working day before Christmas Day, with business resuming on the first
working day after New Year’s Day (close down).
Page 29 of 80

5.57 All Commission workplaces will be closed for business from 3.00pm on Easter
Thursday.
5.58 There will be no deduction from leave credits for the closedown days.
5.59 Employees will be provided with time off for the working days covered by the
‘close down’ period referred to in Clauses 5.56 and 5.57 and will be paid in
accordance with their ordinary hours of work.
5.60 Where an employee is absent on paid leave, on both sides or on one side of
the closedown period, payment for the closedown period will be in accordance
with the employee’s ordinary hours of work. To avoid doubt, if an employee is
on leave at half pay on both sides of the closedown period, the employee will
receive payment for the closedown period at half pay.
5.61 Employees on leave without pay on either side of the close down periods will
not be paid for the closedown days.
5.62 Where the Commissioner approves for an employee to attend for duty during
periods between Monday and Friday during the holiday closedown, the
employee will be eligible for payment or time off in lieu, on the same basis as
for duty on a Sunday for any days that are not public holidays. “Duty on a
Sunday” means that employee will be paid at the rate of double time, which is
inclusive of the single time already paid for the public holiday.

Page 30 of 80

PART 6 – LEAVE
NOTIFICATION OF ABSENCE
6.1

Employees are required to notify their manager (or if unavailable, an agreed
alternative person) of their intended absence as close as possible to the
employee's normal commencement time. If the employee is unable to provide
prior notification of their intended absence, the employee should contact the
manager by phone (and not by email or text message) unless this is not
practicable.

PORTABILITY OF LEAVE
6.2

Where an employee moves (including on promotion or for an agreed period)
from another agency where they were an ongoing APS employee, the
employee’s unused accrued annual leave and personal/carers leave (however
described) will be transferred, provided there is no break in continuity of
service.

6.3

Where an employee is engaged in the Commission as either an ongoing or
non-ongoing employee immediately following a period of ongoing employment
in the Parliamentary Service or the Australian Capital Territory Government
Service, the employee’s unused accrued annual leave and personal/carers
leave (however described) will be recognised unless the employee received
payment in lieu of those entitlements on termination of employment.

6.4

For the purposes of this clause:
•

‘employee’ has the same meaning as under the Public Service Act 1999
(PS Act).

•

‘Parliamentary Service’ refers to employment under the Parliamentary
Service Act 1999.

6.5

Where a person is engaged as an ongoing employee, and immediately prior
to the engagement the person was employed as a non-ongoing APS
employee, the Commissioner may, at the employee’s request, recognise any
accrued annual leave and personal/carers leave (however described),
Page 31 of 80

provided there is no break in continuity of service. Any recognised annual
leave excludes any accrued leave paid out on separation.
UNAUTHORISED ABSENCE
6.6

Where an employee is absent for any period without approval, the absence
will be unpaid and will not count as service for any purpose.

REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS ON CANCELLATION OF LEAVE
6.7

Where an employee has leave cancelled by the Commission or is recalled to
duty and will incur additional and/or unrecoverable costs as a direct result,
reasonable costs as determined by the Commissioner will be reimbursed on
submission of proof of expenditure. An employee will not be entitled to
reimbursement if the costs incurred are otherwise recoverable.

SCHOOL HOLIDAY / FAMILYCARE REIMBURSEMENT
6.8

Where an employee with school children has approved leave cancelled or is
required to return from leave early because of the Commission’s business
requirements during school holidays, the Commissioner may reimburse the
amount paid by the employee for each school child attending approved or
registered care for the approved period of leave.

6.9

Where an employee has approved leave cancelled or is required to return
from leave early because of Commission business requirements and where
the employee can demonstrate that she or he would otherwise have taken
personal responsibility for caring for other family members, the Commissioner
may reimburse some or the entire amount paid by the employee for that family
care.

6.10 Casual employees will not normally be eligible for the reimbursement.
6.11 Reimbursement will apply only for the days when the employee is at work,
except in exceptional circumstances determined by the Commissioner.
6.12 Reimbursement will be net of any government subsidy provided to the
employee.

Page 32 of 80

ANNUAL LEAVE
6.13 A full-time employee is entitled to 4 weeks paid annual leave accruing daily
and credited monthly in arrears. Part-time employees accrue 4 weeks annual
leave per annum calculated on a pro-rata basis.
6.14 The Commissioner may approve annual leave at either full or half pay. If leave
is taken at half pay the deduction from an employee's annual leave credits will
be half the period of leave taken.
6.15 Employees living in remote localities accrue additional annual leave credits as
outlined in Part 8.
6.16 Where an employee has accrued more than 8 weeks annual leave or a prorata amount for part-time employees (or in the case of employees in remote
localities who are entitled to additional annual leave - more than 2 years
credit), the Commissioner may direct the employee to take a period of leave of
not more than a quarter of the total leave accrued.
6.17 An employee will not be directed to take annual leave where the employee:
•

has made an application for annual leave of a period greater than 2 weeks
for full-time employees or a pro-rata amount for part-time employees in the
previous 6 month period and the application was not approved; or

•

is following a management strategy to reduce the employee’s amount of
accrued leave, which has been agreed with their manager.

6.18 An employee’s accrual of annual leave will be reduced where a period or
periods of leave without pay that is not to count as service, exceeds 30 days
in a calendar year. Where leave without pay not to count as service covers an
entire calendar year, no annual leave credit accrues for that year.
PERSONAL/CARER’S LEAVE
Accrual of personal/carer’s leave credits
6.19 Ongoing employees will receive a credit of 10 days personal/carer’s leave
(pro-rata for part-time employees) on engagement and then be entitled to
accrue 8 days personal/carer’s leave (pro-rata for part-time employees) in

Page 33 of 80

their first year of employment. They will then accrue 18 days for each
subsequent year of service accruing daily (pro-rata for part-time employees)
and credited at the completion of each month.
6.20 Non-ongoing employees will accrue 18 days personal/carer’s leave (pro-rata
for part-time employees) per year of service, accruing daily and credited at the
completion of each month.
6.21 An employee’s accrual of personal/carer’s leave will be reduced where a
period or periods of leave without pay that is not to count as service exceeds
30 days in a calendar year. Where leave without pay not to count as service
covers an entire calendar year, no personal/carer’s leave credit accrues for
that year.
Use of personal/carer’s leave
6.22 Subject to availability of credits and the evidentiary requirements of clause
6.25, an employee is entitled to use personal/carer’s leave where they are
required to be absent in the following circumstances:
•

When an employee is unfit for duty due to personal illness or injury (sick
leave), including attendance at preventative medical appointments;

•

to provide care or support (carer’s leave) to a member of the employee’s
family or household because of:
- the member’s personal illness or injury;
- an unexpected emergency affecting the member.

6.23 The Commissioner may, in exceptional circumstances, approve an
employee’s request to convert their paid personal/carers leave credits to half
pay to cover a period of leave in clause 6.22. If leave is taken at half pay, the
deduction from an employee's personal/carer’s leave will be half the period of
leave taken.
Where an employee has insufficient personal/carer’s leave credits
6.24 Where an employee has insufficient paid leave entitlements, the
Commissioner, in exceptional circumstances and subject to the provision of
suitable evidence, may grant personal/carer’s leave with or without pay (to
Page 34 of 80

count or not to count as service). Where leave without pay is granted, the
Commissioner will determine whether, or not, it counts as service and for
which purpose. In the case of leave without pay granted for personal illness,
the leave will count as service for the purposes of the LSL Act and may count
as service for other purposes if the Commissioner determines it does. There is
a maximum of 15 days additional paid leave to be used for caring purposes.
This 15 day limit will be reduced by the amount of personal/carer’s leave the
employee has already utilised in the calendar year for caring purposes.
Evidence for taking personal/carer’s leave
6.25 An employee is required to provide evidence to be entitled to paid
personal/carer’s leave, where the employee is absent from work:
•

for a period in excess of three consecutive work days; and/or

•

for any absence taken in excess of eight days (pro-rata for part-time
employees) paid personal/carer’s leave without supporting evidence per
calendar year.

6.26 Evidence for the purposes of personal/carer’s leave means:
•

a medical certificate from registered health practitioners and registered
health providers;

•

a statutory declaration, if it was not reasonably practicable for the
employee to obtain a medical certificate (it must set out why the employee
is or was unable to attend work, and why it was not reasonably practicable
for them to obtain a medical certificate); and/or

•

with the prior agreement or direction of the Commissioner another form of
evidence, including no evidence. If an employee has a personal illness or
injury which requires ongoing treatment, and/or may result in the employee
taking personal/carer’s leave for illness or injury on a regular or intermittent
basis, and the Commissioner has received medical evidence confirming
the ongoing condition, the Commissioner may approve future leave based
on the initial medical evidence if that medical evidence supported the
future absence.

Page 35 of 80

6.27 The Commissioner may require an employee to provide evidence in other
circumstances. This may include where repeated and frequent single day or
short term absences occur; or the employee has a pattern of taking a
particular day off (e.g. Mondays). If the employee does not provide the
required evidence within a reasonable period, the absence will be treated as
unauthorised leave.
Interaction with other leave types
6.28 Employees who become eligible for leave that is required to be granted in
accordance with the National Employment Standards, other legislation or this
Agreement while on annual or long service leave, may apply for that leave.
Annual and long service leave will be recredited to the extent of the other
leave granted. Such non-discretionary leave includes for example, personal
carer’s leave, compassionate leave, community service leave and maternity
leave.
COMPASSIONATE LEAVE
6.29 An employee is entitled to 3 days of paid compassionate leave and a casual
employee is entitled to 3 days unpaid leave not to count as service for each
occasion to spend time with the member of the employee’s family or
household who has contracted or developed a personal illness or sustained a
personal injury that poses a serious threat to his or her life, or after the death
of the member of the employee’s family or household.
6.30 An employee may be required to provide evidence to the Commissioner in
support of an application for compassionate leave.
6.31 An employee on annual leave, purchased leave or long service leave can, on
production of evidence, apply to take paid compassionate leave and have the
annual leave, purchased leave or long service leave recredited.
6.32 Compassionate leave with pay will count as service for all purposes.
LONG SERVICE LEAVE
6.33 An employee is eligible for long service leave in accordance with the Long
Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.
Page 36 of 80

6.34 The minimum period for which long service leave can be granted is 7 calendar
days at full pay (or 14 days at half pay). Long service leave cannot be broken
with other periods of leave, except as otherwise provided by legislation.
MATERNITY AND PARENTAL LEAVE
6.35 Employees who are pregnant, or who give birth, are covered by the provisions
of the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 (ML Act).
6.36 Employees with an entitlement to paid leave under the ML Act are provided
with an additional two weeks (or 4 weeks if payment is spread) of paid leave
under this Agreement, to be taken continuously with the period of paid
maternity leave provided by the ML Act.
6.37 Employees who adopt/foster or are granted permanent care of a child are
entitled to up to 52 weeks of parental leave, commencing from the time of
placement of the child.
6.38 Up to the first 14 weeks of that adoption/foster/permanent care leave will be
paid leave where an employee is the primary caregiver to the child and where
they satisfy a qualifying service requirement the same as that expressed in
the ML Act applicable to eligibility for paid maternity leave.
6.39 Employees are entitled to parental leave for adoption/foster/permanent care
when that child has not, or will not have, lived continuously with the employee
for a period of 3 months or more as at the day of placement.
6.40 Documentary evidence of approval for adoption/foster/permanent care must
be provided when applying for adoption/foster/permanent care leave.
6.41 Employees who are eligible for paid maternity leave or parental leave may
elect to have the payment for that leave spread over a maximum of 28 weeks
at a rate of half normal salary. Where payment is spread over a longer period,
a maximum of 14 week of the leave period will count as service.
6.42 On ending the initial period of up to 52 weeks of maternity or parental leave,
employees may request an extension of unpaid parental leave for a further

Page 37 of 80

period of up to 52 weeks. The second period of unpaid leave is to commence
immediately following the initial leave period.
6.43 Periods of unpaid parental leave will not count as service for any purpose
unless required by legislation.
6.44 Paid maternity, or parental leave is not extended by public holidays or any
closedown period occurring during the first 12 week period of paid Maternity
Leave, or 24 week period where maternity leave payment is spread.
6.45 Payment for the additional 2 weeks conferred by this Agreement in clause
6.36 (or 4 weeks where payment is spread) will be extended by any public
holidays and/or closedown occurring during that additional 2 (or 4 weeks).
6.46 Where a fostered child is subsequently adopted by the employee, further
leave is not available under clauses 6.37 to 6.42 in relation to the same child
where adoption/foster leave has previously been granted.
6.47 An employee regardless of qualifying service is eligible for 2 days of unpaid
pre-adoption leave to attend any interviews or examinations required for the
adoption of the child. The employee may also take annual leave or purchased
leave for this purpose.
SUPPORTING PARTNER LEAVE
6.48 The Commissioner will grant 4 weeks paid supporting partner leave to an
employee where the employee’s partner has given, or is giving birth, to a
child/ren or whose partner is the primary caregiver for an adopted, fostered or
permanent care child/ren.
6.49 Supporting partner leave is available from one week prior to the expected date
of birth or placement of the child/ren. This leave must be taken within 12
months of the birth or within 12 months from the date when the
adoption/fostering/permanent care commences.
6.50 An employee may be required to provide evidence in support of their
application for leave (e.g. evidence of the birth of a child/ren, or the placement
of an adopted/fostered or permanent care child/ren).
Page 38 of 80

6.51 An employee who is eligible for paid maternity or
adoption/fostering/permanent care leave is not eligible for paid supporting
partner leave.
6.52 The Commissioner may approve an application from an employee to take
supporting partner leave at half pay. An application to take the leave at half
pay will only be approved where the employee applies for the full four week
entitlement to be taken in one continuous period of eight weeks.
6.53 Where the employee has approval to take leave at half pay, only the first 4
weeks of paid leave will count as service.
RETURN TO WORK
6.54 The return to work guarantee provided by section 84 of the FWA applies in
respect of employees ending maternity leave and parental leave.
DEFENCE RESERVE LEAVE
6.55 The Commissioner will grant an employee leave (with or without pay) to
enable the employee to fulfil Australian Defence Force (ADF) Reserve and
Continuous Full Time Service (CTFS) or Cadet Force obligations.
6.56 An employee is entitled to leave with pay, for up to 4 weeks during each
financial year for the purpose of fulfilling service in the ADF Reserve. These
purposes include training and operational duty as required:
•

During the employee’s first year of ADF Reserve service, a further 2
weeks paid leave may be granted to facilitate participation in additional
ADF Reserve training, including induction requirements.

•

With the exception of the additional two weeks in the first year of service,
leave can be accumulated and taken over a period of 2 years, to enable
the employee to undertake training as a member of the ADF Reserves.

•

Employees are not required to pay their tax free ADF Reserve salary to
the Commission in any circumstances.

Page 39 of 80

6.57 Defence Reserve leave counts as service for all purposes, except for unpaid
leave to undertake Continuous Full Time Service (CFTS). Unpaid leave for the
purpose of CFTS counts for all purposes except annual leave.
6.58 Eligible employees may also apply for annual leave, long service leave, leave
without pay, top-up pay or they may use flextime or make up time for the
purpose of fulfilling ADF Reserve, CFTS or Cadet Force obligations.
6.59 Employees are to notify managers at the earliest opportunity once the dates
for ADF Reserve, CFTS or Cadet Force activities are known and/or changed.
MISCELLANEOUS LEAVE
6.60 The Commissioner may grant leave to an employee, either with or without
pay, to count as service or not to count as service; and subject to certain
conditions, in circumstances not provided for elsewhere in this Agreement for
a purpose that the Commissioner considers to be in the interests of the
Agency and having regard to operational requirements. This includes leave for
employees affected by Family and Domestic Violence.
COMMUNITY SERVICE LEAVE
6.61 Paid leave will be provided for an employee engaging in community service
activities including jury service and emergency management activities as
defined in the Fair Work Act 2009.

Page 40 of 80

PURCHASED LEAVE
6.64 The Commissioner may approve the purchase of up to 8 weeks leave funded
by salary deductions over a maximum period of 12 months to ongoing
employees. Non-ongoing employees require more than 12 months service
with the Commission.
6.65 Only one election can be made to purchase this leave in a calendar year. The
Commissioner may agree to vary an election in exceptional circumstances.
6.66 The minimum period of purchased leave that can be taken at any one time will
be 1 day and purchased leave cannot be taken at half pay. Purchased leave
cannot be used to substitute for part-time work arrangements, except if
approved as part of a transition to retirement initiative for an employee 54
years or older. Purchased leave that is approved for single days for the
purpose of transition to retirement, may be approved for a single period up to
a maximum of 2 years and can be accessed once by an employee during their
employment with the Commission.
6.67 Purchased leave will count as service for all purposes including
superannuation purposes. Public holidays and close down periods occurring
during a period of purchased leave will be treated in the same way as if they
had occurred during a period of annual leave.
6.68 Where, due to exceptional circumstances, an employee requests cancellation
of purchased leave before the leave has been taken and the Commissioner
agrees to the request, a refund of the salary deductions made will be paid.
6.69 Where an employee leaves Commission employment, final payments will be
adjusted to take account of deductions not yet made or for deductions made
and leave not taken.
EXTENDED PURCHASED LEAVE
6.70 The Commissioner may grant an employee who has a period of 3 years of
continuous employment with the Commission, access to extended purchased
leave.

Page 41 of 80

6.71 A period of up to 6 months absence on extended purchased leave will be
available following a further 2 years of continuous employment with the
Commission.
6.72 Extended purchased leave does not count as service for any purpose.
Payment during the period of extended purchased leave of up to 6 months will
be based on the amount of money banked in the previous 2 years.
SABBATICAL LEAVE
6.73 The Commissioner may grant an employee sabbatical leave. This is a flexible
arrangement consisting of a 4 year work period followed by a 1 year
sabbatical leave period, with salary paid over 4 years at a rate of 80% per
year. Payment for the fifth year will be based on the amount of money banked
in the previous four years converted to an annual salary.
DEFENCE SERVICE SICK LEAVE
6.74 The Commissioner will grant Defence service sick leave to employees who
are unfit for duty because of an accepted injury or disease. An accepted injury
or disease means a condition accepted by the Department of Veteran’s Affairs
to be:
a) a war caused or Defence-caused injury or disease meeting the
requirements under the Veterans’ Entitlement Act 1986; or
b) a service injury or service disease that meets the requirements under the
Military Rehabilitation Act 2004; or
c) a Defence-related injury or Defence –related disease under the Safety,
Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence- related claims) Act 1988
6.75 An employee who is or becomes eligible for Defence service sick leave is
entitled to:
a) a one-off special credit of 9 weeks Defence Service Sick Leave from
the latter of:
i.

the date of their commencement in the Australian Public Service

(APS); or
Page 42 of 80

ii.

the date on which liability for their injury or disease is accepted

under the relevant Act of Parliament; and
b) each year thereafter, and subject to 6.76, an annual credit of 3 weeks
Defence Service Sick Leave.
6.76 An eligible employee can accrue Defence service sick leave up to a maximum
annual credit balance of 9 weeks.
6.77 An eligible employee must use all of their special credit before their annual
credit.
6.78 Where an employee's Defence service sick leave credits have been
exhausted, personal leave provisions will apply.
6.79 Approval of Defence service sick leave is subject to:
a) the provision of a medical certificate stating the nature of the medical
condition; and
b) written advice from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs verifying that the
medical condition constitutes an accepted injury or disease.
6.80 Defence service sick leave counts as service for all purposes.
6.81 Leave that counts as service for personal/carers’ leave purposes will count as
service for the accrual of Defence service sick leave.

resided in the one locality for a period greater than 21 days, the
Commissioner will negotiate payment of reasonable costs for the temporary
relocation.

PART 9 – RESIGNATION, RETIREMENT, REDEPLOYMENT,
REDUNDANCY AND REDUCTION
RESIGNATION AND RETIREMENT
9.1

Where practical, an employee should give the Commissioner at least 2 weeks’
notice in writing or via email of their intention to resign or retire. The written
notification of resignation or retirement should include the date and time of
effect.

REDEPLOYMENT, REDUNDANCY AND REDUCTION
9.2

The redeployment, redundancy and reduction provisions only apply to ongoing
employees who are not on probation.

9.3

The Commission will take all reasonably practicable steps to avoid the use of
compulsory redundancy or redeployment.

9.4

The Commission will assist employees to maximise their redeployment
opportunities within the Commission and the wider APS and will fund relevant
career and financial counselling.

Definition
9.5

An employee will be considered excess where:
•

the employee is part of a class of employees that is larger in size than is
necessary for the efficient and economical working of the Commission; or

•

the services of the employee can no longer be used effectively because of
technological or other changes in the Commission or changes in the
nature, extent or organisation of the functions of the Commission; or

•

the duties usually performed by the employee are to be performed at a
different locality, the employee is not willing to perform duties at the new
locality and no suitable alternative duties can be identified at the current
locality.

Page 48 of 80

Notification and consultation
9.6

The Commissioner will notify employees who are likely to become excess as
early as possible and, where they choose to have a representative, their
representatives will also be notified.

9.7

The initial notification will usually occur orally to maximise the time employees
have to consider their options.

9.8

When the Commission becomes aware that a significant excess staffing
situation may develop, the Commissioner will advise relevant employees,
managers and employee representatives.

Discussion period
9.9

Following the initial notification the Commissioner will write to the potentially
excess employee(s) formally notifying them of the situation and advising them
of the assistance available. At this stage potentially excess employees will be
able to discuss their situation and options with Commission management, with
this period not exceeding 1 month.

9.10 During the discussion period, the Commissioner may invite employees who
are not potentially excess to express interest in voluntary redundancy where
this would facilitate the redeployment of an employee who is potentially
excess. An employee will not be made redundant voluntarily without
Commissioner approval.
9.11 The discussion period may be shortened by agreement with the employee.
VOLUNTARY REDUNDANCY
9.12 By the end of the 1 month discussion period, the Commissioner may formally
offer a voluntary redundancy to the employee.
9.13 Excess employees will only be offered a voluntary redundancy once during the
redundancy process.
9.14 Where a formal offer of voluntary redundancy is made, employees will have 1
month to consider the offer and advise the Commission that they are either
Page 49 of 80

accepting or rejecting it. Employees who fail to advise the Commission of their
decision by the end of the consideration period will be assumed to have
rejected the offer of voluntary redundancy.
9.15 An employee’s employment will not be terminated on the basis that the
employee is an excess employee within this consideration period unless the
employee has requested this to occur.
9.16 Prior to or during the consideration period, the employee will be provided with
an estimate of their severance pay and pay in lieu of notice and leave
entitlements, relevant taxation rules and the availability of career and financial
counselling in addition to being advised about obtaining further information
relating to superannuation and relevant taxation rules.
9.17 The Commission will reimburse (on production of receipt/s) an employee
considering voluntary redundancy up to $500 (including GST) for career and/or
accredited financial counselling.
9.18 Employees not accepting an offer of voluntary redundancy will be covered by
clauses 9.30–9.42 below.
Redundancy benefit
9.19 An employee who elects for retrenchment with a redundancy benefit and
whose employment is terminated by the Commissioner under s.29 of the PS
Act on the grounds that he/she is excess to requirements, is entitled to
payment of a redundancy benefit of an amount equal of two weeks’ salary for
each completed year of continuous service, plus a pro rata payment for
completed months of service since the last completed year of service, subject
to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the NES.
9.20 The minimum payment will be 4 weeks’ salary and the maximum will be 48
weeks’ salary.
9.21 The redundancy benefit will be calculated on a pro rata basis for any period
where an employee has worked part-time hours during his or her period of

Page 50 of 80

service and the employee has less than 24 years fulltime service, subject to
any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the NES.
9.22

For the purposes of calculating any payment, salary will include:
•

the employee's salary at their ongoing (substantive) classification;

•

higher duties allowance payments (HDA) where the employee has been
receiving HDA continuously for a period of at least 12 months immediately
preceding the employee’s notification of termination date; and

•

an allowance that has been paid during periods of annual leave and on a
regular basis and is not a reimbursement for expenses incurred or a
payment for disabilities associated with the performance of a duty.

Calculating service for redundancy pay purposes
9.23 For the purpose of calculating redundancy pay entitlement (severance),
service means:
•

service in the Commission;

•

Government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976;

•

service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a joint
Commonwealth-State body or a body corporate in which the
Commonwealth does not have a controlling interest) which is recognised
for long service leave purposes;

•

service with the Australian Defence Forces; and

•

service in another organisation where:
-

an employee was transferred from the APS to that organisation to
give effect to an administrative re-arrangement; or

-

an employee engaged by that organisation on work within a function
is appointed as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS, and
such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.

9.24 For earlier periods of service as defined above to count there must be no
breaks between the periods except where:
Page 51 of 80

•

the break in service is less than 1 month and occurs where an offer of
employment with the new employer was made and accepted by the
employee before ceasing employment with the preceding employer; or

•

the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the
employee was deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under
the repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922.

Service not to count as service for redundancy pay purposes
9.25 Absences from duty which do not count as service for long service leave
purposes will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes.
9.26 Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes
are periods of service that ceased by way of:
•

termination under section 29 of the PS Act; or

•

prior to the commencement of the PS Act, by way of redundancy;
forfeiture of office, retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or
loss of qualifications; dismissal or termination of probationary appointment
for reasons of unsatisfactory service; or

•

voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to
the employee; or

•

payment of a redundancy benefit or a similar payment or an employerfinanced retirement benefit.

Period of notice – termination with a voluntary redundancy
9.27 Employees over 45 years of age with at least 5 years continuous service will
be given 5 weeks’ notice. All other employees will be given four weeks’ notice.
9.28 If an employee requests, and the Commissioner agrees, that their employment
be terminated within this notice period, they will be paid compensation for the
unexpired portion of the notice period equal to the hours they would have
worked during the notice period had their employment not been terminated.
9.29 The Commissioner will approve reasonable time off with full pay for the
employee to attend necessary employment interviews from the start of the
Page 52 of 80

notice period. Where expenses to attend interviews are not met by the
prospective employer, the Commissioner will reimburse agreed reasonable
travel and incidental expenses.
INVOLUNTARY REDUNDANCY, RETENTION, REDEPLOYMENT AND
REDUCTION
Retention period
9.30 An excess employee who does not agree to be retrenched with the payment of
a redundancy benefit will be entitled to the following period of retention,
commencing from the date 1 month after the employee received their offer of
voluntary redundancy:
•

13 months where the employee has 20 or more years of service or is over
45 years of age; or

•
9.31

7 months for all other employees.

If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, the
retention period at clause 9.30 will be reduced by the number of weeks
redundancy pay that the employee will be entitled to under the NES on
termination, as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this
clause).

9.32

The retention period will not be extended by periods of leave taken by the
excess employee unless, after considering the circumstances of the individual
case, the Commissioner deems an extension as a result of a period of leave
taken to be reasonable.

9.33

Where the Commissioner is satisfied that there is insufficient productive work
available for the employee during the remainder of the retention period and
that there are no reasonable redeployment prospects in the APS:
•

the Commissioner can terminate the employee’s employment under s.29 of
the PS Act; and

•

upon termination, the employee will be paid a lump sum comprising:

Page 53 of 80

-

the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the NES under
clause 9.31) and this payment will be taken to include the payment in
lieu of notice of termination of employment, plus

-

the employee’s NES entitlement to redundancy pay.

Redeployment
9.34 Employees on a retention period will be considered in isolation from and not in
competition with other applicants when seeking assignment to another position
within the Commission.
9.35 During the retention period, the Commissioner:
•

will take all reasonable steps to find alternative employment for the excess
employee; and/or

•

may reduce the excess employee's classification with the appropriate
notice in order to secure them alternative employment, subject to the
conditions set out in clauses 9.38 and 9.39 below.

9.36 During the retention period the employee will:
•

take reasonable steps to find alternative employment; and

•

actively participate in learning and development activities, trial placements
or other agreed arrangements to assist in obtaining a permanent
placement.

9.37 Excess employees are entitled to necessary leave with pay and assistance in
meeting reasonable travel and incidental expenses when seeking alternative
employment, where these are not met by the prospective employer.
Reduction in classification
9.38 Where the Commissioner proposes to reduce an excess employee’s
classification as a means of securing alternative employment, the employee
will be given 4 weeks’ notice or, if over 45 years of age with at least 5 years’
continuous service, will be given 5 weeks’ notice.

Page 54 of 80

9.39 If reduction occurs before the end of the retention period, the employee will
receive payments to maintain the employee’s salary level for the balance of
the retention period.
Period of notice – termination of the retention period
9.40 An excess employee’s employment will be terminated under s.29 of the PS Act
at the end of their retention period.
9.41 Where an excess employee’s employment is to be terminated they will be
given 4 weeks’ notice. Employees over 45 years of age with at least 5 years’
continuous service will be given 5 weeks’ notice. This notice period will, as far
as practicable, be concurrent with the employee’s retention period.
9.42 If an employee’s employment is terminated within this notice period, they will
be paid compensation for the unexpired portion of the notice period equal to
the hours they would have worked during the notice period had their
employment not been terminated.

PART 11 – DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE
11.1

If a dispute relates to:
a) a matter arising under this Agreement; or
b) the National Employment Standards;
this Part sets out the procedures to settle the dispute.

11.2

An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for
the purposes of the procedures in this term.

11.3

In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute
at the workplace level, by discussions between the employee or employees
and relevant supervisor and/or management.

11.4

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the
dispute may refer the matter to the Fair Work Commission.

11.5

The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in 2 stages:
a) the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it
considers appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an
opinion or making a recommendation; and
b) if the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first
stage, the Fair Work Commission may then:
(i)

arbitrate the dispute; and

(ii)

make a Agreement that is binding on the parties.

Note: If the Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the
powers that are available to it under the Fair Work Act 2009.
A decision that the FWC makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for
the purpose of Division 3 of Part 5.1 of the Fair Work Act 2009. Therefore,
an appeal may be made against the decision.

Page 60 of 80

11.6

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this
Part:
a) An employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally
unless they have a reasonable concern about imminent risk to their health
or safety; and
b) An employee must comply with a direction given by the Commission to
perform other available work at the same workplace, or at another
workplace, unless:
(i)

the work is not safe; or

(ii)

applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not
permit the work to be performed; or

(iii)

the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or

(iv)

there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to
comply with the direction.

11.7

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair
Work Commission in accordance with this Part.
