Section 2 – Our workplace
Participative work practices
11.

12.

13.
14.

The Institute is committed to consulting employees about workplace matters
affecting them in a spirit of cooperation and trust. The Institute values and
encourages full and constructive staff participation in corporate activities and
acknowledges that this requires a commitment of time away from other work,
which will be taken into account by managers.
An employee may have any person of their choice assist, represent or advocate on
behalf of the employee about issues affecting their entitlements and conditions of
employment, where appropriate.
The role of workplace representatives, including workplace delegates, is to be
respected and facilitated in accordance with the Fair Work Act.
The AIHW will maintain a Consultative Committee. The Director will consult
with employees via the Consultative Committee on issues relating to the
implementation and operation of this Agreement, including any changes to
policies named in this Agreement. The Consultative Committee will include at
least four representatives who are members of staff, and meet at least four times a
year. Further information is in the AIHW Consultative Committee Terms of
Reference.

Consultation
15.

16.

17.
18.

19.

Unless a term in this agreement provides for a major change, where a definite
decision is made to introduce major changes in program, organisation, structure
or technology that are likely to have significant effects on staff, the Director will
notify the staff who are likely to be affected by the proposed changes and their
representatives, if any, and the following will apply.
The Director must discuss with the employees affected and their representatives,
if any, the introduction of the changes referred to in clause 15, the effects the
changes are likely to have on employees and measures to avert or mitigate the
adverse effects of such changes on employees and must give prompt and genuine
consideration to matters raised by the employees and/or representatives in
relation to the changes.
The discussions must commence as early as practicable after a definite decision
has been made to make the changes referred to in clause 15.
For the purposes of such discussion, the employees concerned and their
representatives, if any, are to be provided in writing relevant information about
the changes including the nature of the changes proposed, the expected effects of
the changes on employees and any other matters likely to affect employees. The
Director is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive
information to the employees.
Significant effects include:
(i)
terminations of employment
(ii) major changes in the composition, operation or size of the Institute’s
workforce or in the skills required
(iii) the elimination or diminution of job opportunities, promotion opportunities
or job tenure

_____________________________________________________________________________________

20.

21.

22.

(iv) significant alteration in hours of work
(v) the need to retrain employees
(vi) the need to relocate employees to another workplace
(vii) the major restructuring of jobs.
Where the Institute proposes to introduce a change to the regular roster or
ordinary hours of work of employees, the Director will notify the staff who are
likely to be affected by the proposed changes and their representatives, if any.
As soon as practicable after proposing to introduce the change, the Director must
discuss with the employees affected and their representatives, if any, the
introduction of the change, all relevant information about the change including
the nature of the change, information about what the Institute reasonably believes
will be the effects of the change on the employees and information about any
other matters that the employer reasonably believes are likely to affect the
employees. The Director is not required to disclose confidential or commercially
sensitive information to the employees.
The Director will invite the affected employees and their representatives to give
their views about the impact of the change (including any impact in relation to
their family or caring responsibilities), and will give prompt and genuine
consideration to matters raised about the change by the affected employees and
their representatives.

Administrative instruments
23.

The operation of this Agreement is supported by AIHW policies, procedures,
guidelines and other administrative instruments. These instruments are not
incorporated into, and do not form part of, the Agreement. If there is any
inconsistency between these instruments, policies, procedures and guidelines and
the terms of this Agreement, the express terms of this Agreement will prevail.

Managing performance
24.

Managing performance in the Institute is based on the following principles:
(i)
Managers and employees must participate in the Institute’s performance
management framework and are encouraged to have regular, two-way
communication on performance throughout the year.
(ii) All ongoing staff and non-ongoing staff expected to be employed for six
months or longer will have an Individual Performance Agreement (IPA).
(iii) Expectations on performance will take into account the APS Work Level
Standards.
(iv) Performance issues will be promptly communicated with employees and
addressed when they arise, with a focus on strategies to improve
performance.
(v) Appropriate learning and development opportunities will be made
available to assist employees improve their performance.
(vi) At least two formal discussions are to occur each financial year.
Further information is in the Managing for Performance Policy.

Managing underperformance
25.

Where an employee consistently demonstrates performance that is not
satisfactory, the manager will provide written advice of the need for the

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 4

26.

27.

28.

29.

employee’s performance to improve before the process for managing
underperformance commences.
Managing underperformance in the Institute is based on the following principles:
(i)
Employees are entitled to receive assistance from any person of their choice
at any stage of the process for managing underperformance.
(ii) The manager, in consultation with the employee, will promptly develop
and implement strategies to address underperformance.
(iii) The process will be documented in writing and the employee given the
opportunity to comment in writing.
(iv) The employee will be given sufficient time from when the written advice
referred in the preceding clause is first provided to demonstrate satisfactory
performance.
Further information is in the Procedures for Managing Underperformance.
‘Assistance’ in the preceding clause means the provision of advice, guidance and
advocacy by another nominated person or appropriate organisation. Any
advocacy undertaken must be in the presence of the employee, and all decisions
of significance in this process must be solely determined by the employee.
Following the circumstances and action described in the previous clause, if the
employee has not demonstrated satisfactory performance, the Director will then
decide whether to:
(i)
terminate the employee’s employment under section 29 of the Public Service
Act 1999, or
(ii) take some other action, including movement and/or reduction in
classification.
Different procedures for managing underperformance may apply to employees
on probation and non-ongoing employees.
These underperformance procedures do not apply for misconduct or invalidity
reasons.

Learning and development
30.

31.
32.

The Institute will provide employees with access to a range of relevant learning
and development opportunities that may include on-and off-the-job training,
work placements within and outside the Institute (job rotation, transfer and
interchanges), temporary performance at higher levels, substituting for, or
accompanying, higher level staff at meetings, undertaking corporate projects and
formal study.
Participation in approved learning and development programs will be in paid
time, except for Studybank where limitations on paid time apply.
The Institute will support the training of employees for the positions of First Aid
Officer, Emergency Warden, Workplace Health and Safety Representatives, and
Workplace Harassment Contact Officers.

Studybank
33.

The Institute provides for assistance with studies in certain circumstances.
Further information is available in the Studybank Policy and Guidelines.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Employee Assistance Program
34.

The Institute will provide employees with access to confidential professional
counselling to assist with work or personal issues through provision of an
external Employee Assistance Program.

Influenza vaccinations
35.

The Institute will arrange for influenza vaccinations to be provided to employees
on AIHW premises at no cost to staff.

Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace
36.

The Institute supports mothers who are returning to work and who wish to make
arrangements to continue to breast or bottle feed their baby. The Institute will
provide nursing mothers with access to one or two lactation breaks a day, the
timing of which will be negotiated between the employee and their manager.
There will be no deduction from paid leave credits for this purpose. Further
information is in the Workplace breastfeeding/lactation policy.

Parenting room
37.

Where staff numbers justify, as determined by the Director, a parenting room will
be provided and equipped for the occasional use of employees needing to care for
children. Further information can be found in the Parenting Room Guidelines.

Teleworking

in a location other than an AIHW office on a regular, temporary or intermittent
basis. Further information can be found in the Teleworking Guidelines.

Resignation
39.

40.
41.

A staff member may resign or retire from the Institute by giving the required
amount of written notice, being a period of two weeks’ notice for APS Level staff,

52.

The ordinary hours of work for full-time employees are 74 hours 10 minutes per
fortnight.
The standard hours for full-time employees are from 8.30 am to 12.30 pm and
1.30 pm to 4.55 pm from Monday to Friday.
Part-time employees are engaged for ordinary hours of work which are less than
the ordinary hours of work for a full-time employee. Standard hours of work for
part-time employees are as agreed between the manager and the employee.
The span of hours in which a staff member may work ordinary hours is 8.00am to
6.00pm Monday to Friday.
Core hours for the Institute are from 10.00am to 12.00pm and from 2.00pm to
4.00pm.
Managers will develop an agreed working pattern with each employee whom
they supervise.
An employee will not work more than five hours without a meal break of at least
30 minutes.
An employee will not normally work more than 10 hours on any one day.
Where no agreement is reached under clause 47 an employee will work standard
hours.
Employees are expected to be available for reasonable direction to work outside
agreed patterns of work on an occasional basis.
An employee may work outside an agreed pattern of work on an occasional basis.
Where this involves working outside the Institute’s span of hours or more than 10
hours on any one day, it requires prior approval from his or her manager. Any
hours worked on this basis will be considered ordinary hours and not attract
overtime rates.

Recording attendance
53.
54.

APS 1-6 employees will record their actual times of arrival and departure and any
breaks each day.
Executive Level employees are not required to record their actual hours of
attendance, unless requested by their manager. Executive Level employees may
be required to provide evidence of their attendance to substantiate any request for
time off in lieu (TOIL).

Flexible working hours
55.

56.

The flextime system is provided for all APS Level 1–6 employees. Part-time
employees may access flextime arrangements, subject to agreement with his or
her manager. Further information is available in the AIHW’s guidelines on
‘Working Hours, Recording Attendance and Flextime’.
The following flextime arrangements will apply:
(i)
An employee may carry over a maximum flextime credit of 30 hours at the
end of a four-week settlement period, unless approved by a senior manager.
(ii) An employee may carry over a maximum of 10 hours flex debit
accumulated in any one settlement period into the next settlement period.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016

(iii)

57.
58.

59.
60.

An employee may take up to five days of flex leave in one settlement
period.
The use of flex leave during core hours must have the prior approval of the
manager.
Employees in jobs that require attendance at pre-determined times to meet client
service needs must have their manager’s prior approval to use flex leave during
standard hours.
APS employees acting at the EL1 level will not access formal flextime
arrangements unless approved to do so by the Director.
Executive Level employees may access flexible working hours, consistent with
clause 61 and with operational requirements.

Recognition of extended hours for Executive Level staff
61.
62.
63.

64.

Executive Level employees may at times be required to work extended hours.
The manager may approve paid time off (time off in lieu, or TOIL) to recognise
the extended hours.
For the purposes of the preceding clause, TOIL may not be taken on a one-for-one
basis except for:
(i) time necessarily worked by an Executive Level 1 employee in excess of one
additional hour on any normal business day, or
(ii) any time necessarily worked by an Executive Level 1 employee on weekends
and public holidays.
TOIL taken on a one-for-one basis does not reduce the employee’s right to access
fair and reasonable time off for other additional hours worked.
In exceptional circumstances the Director may approve payment for additional
hours worked by Executive Level employees.

Reversion to standard hours
65.

66.

67.

Access to flexible working conditions will not apply in circumstances where:
(i)
an employee's manager reasonably considers the employee's attendance is
unsatisfactory
(ii) an employee's manager reasonably considers that an employee is misusing
the arrangements.
In the situation described in the preceding clause access to flexible working
arrangements will be restored where a manager is satisfied that the employee’s
attendance is satisfactory.
Where an employee is absent from duty without approval:
(i)
the period of absence will not count as service for any purpose
(ii) the employee will not be paid or be entitled to other benefits provided for
under this agreement in respect of the period, or periods, of absence
(iii) any amounts paid to an employee in respect of an unauthorised absence are
overpayments, which the Director will seek to recover
(iv) the Director may determine that the employee will revert to standard hours
on their return. Flexible arrangements will be restored where the Director is
satisfied that the employee’s attendance is satisfactory.

Regular part-time work
68.

Where consistent with operational requirements, and subject to the agreement of
the relevant manager, the Institute will approve applications from employees

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 8

69.

70.

71.

wanting to work on a regular part-time basis. Arrangements may be approved for
either a fixed period or on an ongoing basis.
Unless otherwise provided for in legislation, remuneration and other benefits for
part-time employees will be calculated on a pro-rata basis apart from those
allowances of an expense nature, where part-time employees will receive the
same amount as full-time employees. Further details on the pro-rata leave
arrangements are in Section 4 – Leave arrangements.
A part-time employee and his or her manager may, by agreement, vary regular
hours of work. Similarly, part-time working arrangements may be terminated by
agreement between an employee and his or her manager.
Full-time employees will not be required to convert to part-time hours without
their agreement.

Travelling time and working extended hours (APS Level 1-6 only)
72.

When employees accessing flextime are required to work in a different city, in
addition to any extended hours worked, they may record the additional time of
duration of the journeys as working time on their flexsheets. That is, any
travelling time between their homes to the other workplace that is additional to
the time normally spent getting between home and their normal place of work.
Time recorded on this basis will be considered ordinary hours and not attract
Overtime rates. The method of travel is subject to the prior approval of the
manager.

Overtime and recompense for overtime (APS Level 1-6 only)
73.

74.

75.

76.

77.

Overtime means work performed at the prior direction of management by
employees at or below APS Level 6 that:
(i)
is in excess of 8 hours 25 minutes on any one day
(ii) is outside the span of hours specified in clause 45
(iii) is performed on weekends or public holidays.
Flexible working hours (see Flexible working hours) will generally be used to
meet operational requirements within the span of hours. However, it is
recognised that operational requirements will on occasions require an
employee(s) to be directed to work outside the span of hours or in excess of
8 hours 25 minutes on any one day. In accordance with section 62 of the Fair
Work Act 2009, an employee may refuse to work additional hours if they are
unreasonable.
Overtime is considered to be continuous with ordinary duty when an employee
does not have a break, other than a meal break, between the periods of ordinary
duty and overtime.
Time off in lieu is the standard form of recompense for overtime performed in
continuous periods on normal business days. Payment is the standard form of
recompense for overtime performed on all other occasions.
Where overtime is worked, recompense (whether payment or time off in lieu) is
calculated at the following rates (see Attachment A.2 – Salary rates for overtime
formulae):
(i)
Monday to Saturday: Time and a half for the first three hours of overtime
worked each day and double time thereafter.
(ii) Sunday: Double time.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 9

Public holiday: Double time and a half for duty outside the standard hours
specified in clause 43. For duty within the standard hours, TOIL will be
calculated at double time and a half, but payment will be calculated at time
and a half additional to the single time as employees are already being paid
for the public holiday.
Part-time APS 1-6 Level employees are eligible for overtime for work performed
at the prior direction of management, which:
(i)
is not continuous with the employee’s agreed standard hours
(ii) exceeds the employee’s agreed total standard hours over the four-week
settlement period.
Where APS Level 1-6 employees other than employees receiving an emergency
out-of-hours contact officer allowance (see clause 223) are called into work to
meet an emergency outside the span of hours specified in clause 45 or are
required to work overtime for a period that is not continuous with their ordinary
duty, they will be paid for the period of work and any time necessarily spent in
travelling to and from work at the relevant overtime rate.
The minimum payment on each occasion will be two hours. However, where
more than one attendance is involved, the minimum overtime payment provision
will not operate to increase an employee's overtime remuneration beyond the
amount which would have been received had the employee remained on duty
from the commencing time of duty on one attendance to the ceasing time of duty
on a following attendance.
Where employees are required to work beyond the normal span of hours as set
out in clause 45, the Institute will meet all fair and necessary additional costs
associated with safe travel arrangements between work and their usual place of
residence.
Where an employee is required to work overtime for a continuous period to the
completion of or beyond a meal period, he or she will be paid a reasonable
amount for overtime meal allowance as determined by the annual Taxation
Ruling on reasonable travel and meal allowance expense amounts. For the
purpose of this clause, meal period means any of the following periods: 6.00 am
to 8.00 am, 12.00 pm to 2.00 pm and 6.00 pm to 8.00 pm.
Where an employee works overtime he or she will be entitled to an 8-hour break
plus reasonable travelling time before recommencing work. If an employee is
required to resume or continue work without having had the required break, then
payment at double time will be made for the time worked until the employee has
had the required break.
(iii)

78.

79.

80.

81.

82.

83.

Blood donation
84.

Employees will be provided with time off to donate blood. There will be no
deduction from paid leave credits for this purpose.

Mature age employees
85.

The Institute is committed to using ways of retaining access to the pool of skills
and knowledge valuable to the work of the Institute possessed by staff that are
nearing retirement age. Subject to operational requirements, these include, but
may not be confined to, negotiating flexible employment arrangements with staff
nearing retirement.

Where an employee transfers to the Institute from an agency that employees
under the Public Service Act 1999, the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, or from the
ACT Government Service the employee’s unused accrued annual leave and
personal/carer’s leave (however described) will be transferred or recognised
provided there is no break in continuity of service of more than two months.
Any recognised annual leave excludes any accrued leave paid out on separation.
The conditions applying to these accrued credits of leave, and any future
entitlements to annual leave and personal/carer’s leave, shall be those prevailing
in the Institute.

Annual leave
88.

89.

90.
91.

92.

93.

Employees who are not paid a casual rates loading are entitled to four weeks’
paid annual leave for each full year of service. Annual leave will accrue on a prorata basis for part-time employees.
Annual leave will accrue on a daily basis and the employee will be able to access
the leave as it accrues. Annual Leave will not accrue during periods that are
taken as not to count as service.
An employee’s entitlement is expressed in hours and minutes. Leave taken will
be deducted in hours and minutes.
The taking of annual leave is subject to approval of the Director. Annual leave
may be approved for part-days, a whole day or multiple days. Annual leave
counts as service for all purposes.
An employee who is not participating in the purchased leave scheme may apply
to take annual leave on half pay. Any leave approved under these provisions will
be deducted from annual leave credits at half rate. The minimum absence of leave
on half pay is two working days.
Where an employee's leave is cancelled without reasonable notice or an employee
is recalled to work from leave, the Institute will pay for reasonable expenses, as
determined by the Director, not otherwise recoverable under any insurance or
from any other source.

Excess annual leave
94.

An employee who has accumulated more than 2 years and 9 months (55 days for
full-time employees, pro-rata for part-time employees) of annual leave credit may
be directed to take annual leave to such time as the employee’s leave balance is
reduced to no more than two years credit within 12 weeks of the direction.

Cash-out of annual leave
95.

96.

An employee may request to cash-out an amount of annual leave provided their
remaining accrued entitlement to annual leave is not less than four weeks. The
rate of payment is the same as if they had taken the annual leave.
The Director will not approve requests to cash out leave in accordance with these
clauses unless the employee has taken at least three weeks annual leave in the
previous 12 months preceding the request to cash out leave.

Employees are limited to only one application each calendar year, and each
application is a separate written agreement between the employee and the
Director.

Personal/carer’s leave
98.

An employee may take personal/carer’s leave in the following circumstances:
(i)
due to personal illness or injury affecting the employee (sick leave)
(ii) to care for a member of the employee’s immediate family or household who
requires care or support because of a personal illness or personal injury
affecting the member
(iii) where an employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family or
household is affected by an unexpected emergency.
99. Personal/carer’s leave may be approved for part-days, a whole day or multiple
days.
100. Ongoing employees will be credited with an entitlement of 18 days
personal/carer’s leave at full pay on engagement and on each anniversary
thereafter. Personal/carer’s leave is cumulative.
101. On engagement as an ongoing employee, former non-ongoing employees will be
credited with 18 days personal/carer’s leave and that credit adjusted for
previously taken leave.
102. Leave for part-time employees will be credited based on the weekly hours
worked as at the date of personal/carer’s leave accrual. Approved personal leave
will be deducted from credits in hours and minutes, with no salary variation.
103. Non-ongoing employees engaged under section 22(2)(b) of the Public Service Act
1999 are entitled to 18 days personal/carer’s leave per year, or the part-time
equivalent, accruing daily and is credited monthly.
104. An employee who is engaged as an irregular or intermittent employee under
section 22(2)(c) of the Public Service Act 1999, and in receipt of a casual
rates loading, is not entitled to paid personal/carer’s leave.
105. An employee must advise his or her manager personally if possible (or ensure
that the manager is advised) of an absence or an intention to be absent from the
place of work. The advice needs to be as soon as possible, preferably within an
hour of an employee’s usual commencement time.
106. Unless otherwise agreed by the manager, no more than three consecutive days of
personal/carer’s leave may be taken without medical evidence or documentation
from a registered health professional. A manager may accept a statutory
declaration from the employee if it is not practical to obtain independent
evidence.
107. A manager may request medical evidence or other evidence to support a current
or future application for personal/carer’s leave, where there is cause to believe
that the reasons for such absences, irrespective of the length of absence, are not
reasonable or legitimate. Where possible, the manager will give the employee
prior notice to provide such evidence.
108. Where any leave without pay not to count as service has been approved in the
accrual year, personal/carer’s leave accrual will be deferred by the period of
leave without pay taken.

under these provisions will be deducted from personal/carer’s leave credits at
half rate.
111. In exceptional circumstances, an employee who does not have any current
personal/carer’s leave credits, but is otherwise eligible for personal/carer’s leave,

accrue personal/carer’s leave on the basis of hours actually worked.

Compassionate leave
117. The Director will approve leave with pay to an ongoing or non-ongoing employee
(but not an irregular or intermittent employee) on each occasion that a member of
the employee’s immediate family, a member of the employee’s household, or a
person who was clearly dependent on the employee for care, support and
attention:
(i)
contracts or develops a personal illness that poses a serious threat to his or
her life
(ii) sustains a personal injury that poses a serious threat to his or her life
(iii) dies.
118. An employee is entitled to three days paid leave for a bereavement and two days
on other occasions. The employee may take the period as a single period of leave
or any separate periods on which the employee and the Director agree. The
Director may grant further periods of leave for compassionate or bereavement
purposes as miscellaneous leave with or without pay on a case by case basis.
119. An employee who is engaged as an irregular or intermittent employee under
section 22(2)(c) of the Public Service Act 1999, and in receipt of a casual

120. The Director may require the employee to provide evidence of the illness, injury
or death in support of the request for leave and the nature of the relationship
between the person and the employee. If the incident occurs while the employee
is on paid leave, such paid leave may be re-credited to the extent of the
Compassionate Leave granted.
121. An employee cannot apply for compassionate leave during a period of approved
leave without pay.

Purchased leave scheme
122. The Director may approve the purchase by an employee of additional leave of
one, two, three or four weeks per year. Further information is in the Institute’s

124. An employee who is participating in the purchased leave scheme may not apply
to take annual leave on half pay.

Long service leave
125. Long service leave will be provided to eligible employees in accordance with the
Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.
126. The minimum period of any approved long service leave granted will be seven

Return to work after parental leave
138. On ending parental leave, an employee is entitled to return to the employee’s preparental leave duties. If those duties no longer exist, an employee is entitled to
return to an available position for which the employee is qualified and suited, at
the same classification and pay as applied prior to the parental leave taken.
Where this is not practical, other duties will be sought, with the redeployment,
reduction and redundancy provisions applying to any placement.

Flexible work arrangements for parents
139. In addition to the provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009 that permit employees to
request a change in working conditions, an employee who has completed at least
12 months of continuous qualifying service and has responsibility for the care of a
child under school age or a child under 18 who has a disability will be provided
with access to regular part-time work where the requested work pattern is at least
three full-time days (that is, three days of 7 hours 25 minutes) or no less than 25

145. Employees are not required to pay their tax free ADF Reserve salary to the
Institute in any circumstances.
146. An employee who is an officer or instructor of cadets in a Cadet Force may be
granted paid leave of up to three weeks each financial year to perform duties as
an officer or instructor of cadets. For these purposes ‘Cadet Force’ means the
Australian Navy Cadets, Australian Army Cadets, or the Australian Air Force

147. Defence Reserve leave counts as service for all purposes, except for unpaid leave
to undertake CFTS. Unpaid leave for the purpose of CFTS counts for all purposes

148. Eligible employees may also apply for annual leave, long service leave,
miscellaneous leave without pay, top-up pay or they may use flextime for the
purpose of fulfilling ADF Reserve or CFTS obligations.

War service sick leave
151. Employees may be eligible to be granted war service sick leave while unfit for
duty because of a war-caused condition.
152. A war-caused condition means an injury or disease of an employee that has been
determined under the relevant legislation to be war-caused or defence-caused.
153. Eligible employees will accrue a special credit of nine weeks on commencement
in the APS and an annual credit of three weeks for each year of APS service.
Unused credits will accumulate to a maximum of nine weeks.
154. The special credit must be used before the annual credits. Where an employee's
war service sick leave credits have expired, personal/carer’s leave provisions will
apply.
155. Approval of a grant of war service sick leave will be subject to the provision of a
medical certificate stating the nature of the medical condition and a statement
from the Department of Veterans' Affairs stating the medical condition is a warcaused condition.
156. Leave that counts as service for personal/carer’s leave purposes will count as
service for war service sick leave purposes.

Cultural leave for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees

leave each year to participate in NAIDOC week activities or other cultural or
ceremonial events.

Community service leave
159. An eligible community service activity includes:
(i)
jury service (including attendance for the purpose of jury selection) that is
required by or under a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory
(ii) carrying out a volunteer emergency management activity (within the
meaning of section 109(2) of the Fair Work Act 2009).
160. In relation to jury service, the Director will approve paid community service leave
to enable an employee to attend court appearances as a juror. In this event, the
employee will continue to receive their normal salary subject to any payments of
a salary nature made to the employee by the court for jury service being signed
over to the Institute.
161. An employee who engages in an eligible community service activity is entitled to
paid leave for each period of service if:
(i)
the period consists of one or more of the following:
a. time when the employee engages in the activity
b. reasonable travelling time associated with the activity
c. reasonable rest time immediately following the activity

(iii) the employee’s absence is reasonable in all the circumstances.

Miscellaneous leave
162. The Director may grant leave not provided for elsewhere to an employee for a
purpose that the Director considers to be in the interests of the Institute, having
regard to operational requirements. Further information is in the Leave
Guidelines.
163. Miscellaneous Leave may be granted:
(i)
for the period requested or for another period
(ii) with or without pay
(iii) subject to conditions.
164. Where an employee is granted Miscellaneous leave without pay (LWOP), the
Director will determine whether the period of LWOP counts as service for the
purposes of annual and personal leave entitlements.

to the following public holidays:
(i) New Year's Day (1 January)

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 17

(viii) Boxing Day (26 December)
(ix) any other day, or part-day, declared or prescribed by or under a law of a
State or Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a
region of the state or territory, as a public holiday, other than a day or partday, or a kind of day or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work
regulations from counting as a public holiday.
166. If under a State or Territory law, a day or part-day is substituted for one of the
public holidays listed above, then the substituted day or part-day is the public
holiday.
167. The Institute will treat the following days as public holidays for the purposes of
determining employee entitlements:
(i) 27 December if Christmas Day falls on a Monday or Tuesday
(ii) 28 December if Christmas Day falls on a Sunday
(iii) 29 December if Christmas Day falls on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday.
168. The Director and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day or part-day
that would otherwise be a public holiday, having regard to operational
requirements.
169. An employee who is absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in the
place where the employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid for
the part or full day absence as if that day or part-day was not a public holiday,
except where that person would not normally have worked on that day.
170. Where a public holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on Long
Service or Maternity leave there is no entitlement to receive payment as a public
holiday. Payment for that day would be in accordance with the entitlement for
that form of leave (e.g. if on long service leave on half pay, payment is on half
pay).

Christmas closure
171. The Institute will be closed on ordinary business days between Christmas Day
and New Year’s Day.
172. Employees are entitled to be absent with pay for the working days during
Christmas closure. Payment for such absences will be made in accordance with an
employee’s usual ordinary hours of work for that day. However, where an
employee would otherwise be absent on leave on that day, the rate of payment
will be in accordance with the payment for that leave entitlement.

Section 5 – Remuneration
Salary increases
173. All salaries will increase by 3.0% with effect from the date of commencement of
this Agreement. All salaries will increase by a further 2.0% 12 months after
commencement, and a further 1.0% 24 months after commencement.

Salary rates
174. Attachment A.1 – Salaries details the salary rates payable to employees for the
duration of this Agreement.
175. For members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the
Public Sector Superannuation (PSS) Defined Benefit scheme (PSSdb), these rates
are salaries for the purposes of superannuation, leave, severance benefit and
termination payments. For members of the PSS Accumulation Plan (PSSap) and
other superannuation schemes, these rates are salaries for the purposes of leave,
severance benefit and termination payments. Where an allowance is identified as
counting towards superannuation, the allowance will be included in the
superannuation salary for members of all superannuation schemes.
Supported wage for employees with a disability
176. Supported salary rates and conditions of employment as set out in Attachment B Supported salary payments for employees with a disability shall apply to an
employee with a disability who is eligible for consideration under the supported
wage scheme.
Casual rates
177. Employees engaged on an irregular or intermittent basis will be paid a casual
rates loading. This loading is paid in lieu of access to payment for public holidays
on which the employee is not rostered to work and paid leave, except for long
service leave. The loading is 20% of the salary for the relevant pay-point.

Method of payment
178. Employees will have their fortnightly salary (calculated by using the formulae at
Attachment A.2 – Salary rates) paid by electronic funds transfer into a financial
institution account of their choice.
179. The Director may approve the prepayment of salary to an employee where
special circumstances exist.

Salary packaging
180. Employees may choose to sacrifice a proportion of the salary component of their
remuneration package consistent with the Institute’s salary packaging guidelines.
181. All fringe benefits taxes and administrative costs that are incurred because of the
salary packaging arrangements will be met by the employee on a salary sacrifice
basis.
182. When an employee enters into a salary sacrifice arrangement, salary for all
purposes will be the pre-sacrifice salary rate.

Superannuation
183. The Institute will make compulsory employer superannuation contributions as
required by the applicable legislation and fund requirements. The
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 19

superannuation salary will not be reduced by any amounts that the employee
chooses to salary sacrifice.
184. Employer contributions to the PSSap will be the rate specified by the rules of
PSSap but not less than 15.4% of the employee’s superannuation salary,
calculated according to the ordinary time earnings method. Employer
contributions for employees in other accumulation scheme plans will be at the
same rate as for PSSap. This will not be reduced by any other contributions made
through salary sacrifice arrangements. This clause does not apply where a
superannuation fund cannot accept employer superannuation contributions (e.g.
unable to accept contributions for people aged over 75).
185. During periods of paid parental leave (which includes maternity, adoption, foster
and partner leave), employer contributions to all complying accumulation
superannuation funds including PSSap will continue at the rate payable in the
full pay period immediately prior to commencing parental leave.
186. The Director may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying
superannuation funds that allow contributions to be paid through fortnightly
electronic funds transfer (EFT) with data uploaded from an electronic batch file.
Any fees associated with EFT will be borne by the Institute. Any other fees
applied by a chosen fund associated with the administration of superannuation
contributions will be borne by the employee.

Salary on commencement or promotion
187. Where an employee commences work with the Institute, salary will be payable at
the minimum point of the salary range applicable to the classification of the job.
In exceptional circumstances, the Director may approve the payment of a salary
above the minimum pay-point, having regard to the experience, qualifications
and skills of the employee.
188. Where an employee is promoted within the Institute, salary will be payable at
either the minimum point of the salary range applicable to the classification of the
job, or at a higher pay-point if they have already attained that level through
temporary performance as per the pay-point advancement rules in clause 199.
The Director may approve the payment of a salary above the minimum pay-point
where the employee has performed satisfactorily at that level in the AIHW on a
temporary basis for a total period of at least six months in the previous two years.
189. The Director may decide that an existing APS employee moving to the Institute at
the same classification level whose current salary exceeds the maximum paypoint in the AIHW for that classification will be maintained on that salary on
commencement. This salary will not be subject to any increases under this
Agreement until such time that the highest pay-point of the employee’s
classification becomes higher than the employee’s salary, at which time the
employee will move to the next pay-point.

Pay-point advancement rules
190. Employees are eligible for advancement to the next pay-point on either 1 March
or 1 September each year. Each employee's first eligible advancement date within
a classification level will be whichever of those two dates is more than six months
and no more than 12 months after the date on which the employee was first
substantively appointed to that classification level in the Institute. Subsequent
advancement dates within that classification will be 12 months after the date on
which the employee last received advancement.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 20

191. Non-ongoing employees and employees who have been on long-term leave must
also have performed an aggregate of at least six months’ work in the 12 months
ending on the relevant advancement date in the Institute at the relevant
classification level or higher. If not, they will be eligible on the next advancement
date before which they have worked an aggregate of at least six months in the
preceding 12 months. The Director may waive this six month qualifying period
in exceptional circumstances.
192. Advancement within each classification level will be on the basis of performance
review. Employees who have performed satisfactorily will be advanced to the
next pay-point within their classification level. Further information is in the
Managing for Performance Policy.
193. If employees who are assessed as less than satisfactory subsequently improve
their performance to a satisfactory level they would then be re-considered for
advancement at the next common advancement date six months later.

Temporary reassignment of duties at a higher level, and higher duties
allowance
194. Where an employee is required to temporarily perform higher duties for a
continuous period of five working days or more, and accepts the full
responsibility and accountability that attaches to that job, the Director will
approve an allowance in accordance with the following clause for the entire
period.
195. Higher duties allowance must be paid at an existing pay-point, and the amount of
the allowance is the difference between the employee’s salary at his or her
substantive level, and the pay-point at which s/he is being paid for the higher
duties. It is normally paid at the bottom pay-point of the temporary reassignment
level range.
196. Where an employee is required to temporarily perform higher duties that
constitute only part of the responsibility and accountability that normally attaches
to the higher-level position (‘partial performance’) for a continuous period of five
working days or more, the Director may approve an appropriate amount of
higher duties allowance at a pay-point which is higher than the employee’s
substantive classification level pay-point, but lower than the bottom pay-point of
the range of the temporary reassignment level. Where an employee’s substantive
pay-point is at the top of the range of the level immediately below the temporary
reassignment level, there is no capacity to approve ‘partial performance’.
197. An employee who is receiving higher duties allowance, and has approved paid
leave or observes a public holiday within the approved period, will continue to
receive the allowance during that absence. However, the period of higher duties
will not start at the beginning of a leave period.
198. The allowance will be recognised for superannuation purposes subject to CSS and
PSS rules, and for the purpose of calculation of a severance benefit if it has been
received for a continuous period of at least 12 months (see Rate of payment:
severance benefit).
199. An employee who is receiving higher duties allowance will be first eligible for
pay-point advancement in the higher classification level on 1 March or 1
September provided they have worked for a continuous period of more than six
months at a particular pay-point in the higher level on that date.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 21

200. Employees, who have performed satisfactorily at the higher level, will be
advanced to the next pay-point within that classification level. Further
information is available in the AIHW Managing for Performance Policy.
201. If the employee continues to work at that higher level or is promoted to that level
on a substantive basis subsequent advancement dates will be 12 months after the
date on which the employee last received advancement.
202. Where an employee performs higher duties in broken periods:
(i)
pay-point advancement will be due on 1 March or 1 September each year
when an employee has satisfactorily performed more than six months
higher duties at a particular pay-point in the higher classification level in a
twenty-four month period ending on those dates
(ii) an employee who does not perform higher duties at that classification for

additional costs incurred as a result of the employee being temporarily relocated.

Reimbursement of fares
211. Where an employee becomes critically or dangerously ill while he or she is
travelling on official business, and a member of the employee’s immediate family

employee’s immediate family for reasonable travel costs.

Overseas travelling allowances
212. Where an employee is required to travel overseas on official business, he or she

Regulations 1997.

Loss, damage and indemnity
217. Where an employee incurs out-of-pocket expenses due to loss or damage to

Section 7 – Management of excess employees
Redeployment and retrenchment
231. These provisions only apply to ongoing employees who are not on probation and
with more than one year’s service.
232. Throughout the application of the following provisions:
(i)
the Director will take all reasonable steps to transfer an excess employee to
a suitable position at an equal classification level within the Institute or in
another APS agency
(ii) an employee and, where the employee chooses, their representative may
raise issues concerning a retrenchment situation directly with his or her
manager.

Discussion period
233. When the Director is aware that an employee(s) is likely to become excess to
requirements, the Director will at the earliest practicable time advise the
employee(s) of the situation.
234. Discussions with the potentially excess employee(s) or, where an employee
requests, with the employee's representative, will be held to consider:
(i)
reasons why the employee(s) is likely to become excess
(ii) measures which might be taken to reduce the incidence of an employee
becoming excess
(iii) redeployment opportunities including the potential for a job exchange with
another APS agency for the employee(s) concerned and identifying whether
the employee(s) seeks redeployment
(iv) whether voluntary retrenchment might be appropriate and whether the
employee(s) wants to be offered voluntary retrenchment.
235. The Director may, prior to the conclusion of these discussions, invite employees
who are not potentially excess to express interest in voluntary retrenchment,
where those retrenchments permit the redeployment of employees who are
potentially excess.
236. The Director will not advise an employee that he or she is excess until the
discussions referred to in clause 234 have occurred. The period of these
discussions will be one month, unless the employee agrees to a lesser period or
both the Director and the employee agree to a greater period.

Voluntary retrenchment
237. Following the discussion period and subject to clause 232, the Director may
declare an employee or employees to be excess by notification in writing, and will
make an offer of voluntary retrenchment to each excess employee.
238. The employee(s) identified as excess have two options:
(i)
to accept voluntary retrenchment, which means termination of APS
employment and entitlement to a severance benefit
(ii) to reject voluntary retrenchment, which means the provisions relating to
Retention periods apply.
239. Where the Director makes a written offer of voluntary retrenchment to an excess
employee, the employee will have one month to elect to accept or reject the offer.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 26

The Director will not give notice of termination of employment before the end of
that period or until an election is received (in circumstances where the election is
received before the end of that period). At least one week must have expired
before an election can be made – that is, the employee must take at least one week
to give the matter due consideration.
240. Within the one-month election period identified in the preceding clause the
employee must be given information on the:
(i)
amount of severance pay
(ii) amount of pay in lieu of notice
(iii) amount of paid up leave credits
(iv) amount of accumulated superannuation contributions
(v) options open concerning superannuation
(vi) taxation rules applying to the various payments.

Financial counselling
241. An employee declared excess is entitled to an amount up to $500 (including GST)
for financial counselling.

Period of notice
242. Where the employee agrees to be voluntarily retrenched, the Director can
approve the termination of the employee's employment under section 29 of the
Public Service Act 1999, and upon approval will give the required notice of
termination. The period of notice will be four weeks (or five weeks for an
employee over 45 years of age with at least five years of continuous service).
243. Where an employee resigns or is terminated at the beginning of, or within, the
notice period, the employee will receive payment in lieu of notice for the
unexpired portion of the notice period.

Severance benefit
244. An employee whose employment is terminated by the Director under section 29
of the Public Service Act 1999 on the grounds that he or she is excess to
requirements is entitled to be paid a sum equal to two weeks’ salary for each
completed year of continuous service (subject to clauses 245 to 249), plus a pro
rata payment for completed months of service since the last completed year of
service, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the
Fair Work Act 2009 National Employment Standards (NES).
245. For earlier periods of service to count, there must be no breaks between the
periods of service, except where:
(i) the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of
employment with the new employer was made and accepted by the
employee before ceasing employment with the previous employer
(ii) the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the
employee was deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under the
repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922.
246. The minimum payable will be four weeks’ salary and the maximum will be
48 weeks’ salary.
247. The severance benefit will be calculated on a pro rata basis for any period where
an employee has worked part-time hours during their period of service and the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 27

employee has less than 24 years of full-time service, subject to any minimum
amount the employee is entitled to under the NES.
248. Subject to the following clause, service for severance pay purposes means:
(i)
service in the Institute
(ii) government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976
(iii) service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a Joint
Commonwealth-State body corporate in which the Commonwealth does
not have a controlling interest) which is recognised for long service leave
purposes
(iv) service with the Australian Defence Forces
(v) APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation (as defined under
the repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922), if the service has not
previously been recognised for severance pay purposes
(vi) service in another organisation where an employee was transferred from
the APS to that organisation with a transfer of function or an employee
engaged by that organisation on work within a function is appointed as a
result of the transfer of that function to the APS and such service is
recognised for long service leave purposes.
249. Absences from work which do not count as service for any purpose will not count
as service for severance pay purposes. Additionally, any period of service which
ceased:
(i)
through termination on the following grounds:
a. the employee lacks, or has lost, an essential qualification for
performing his or her duties
b. non-performance, or underperformance, of duties
c. inability to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity
d. failure to satisfactorily complete an entry level training course
e. failure to meet a condition imposed under subsection 22(6) of the
Public Service Act 1999
f. a breach of the Code of Conduct
(ii) on a ground equivalent to a ground listed in subparagraph (i) above under
the repealed Public Service Act 1922
(iii) through voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age
applicable to the employee
(iv) with the payment of a redundancy benefit or similar payment or an
employer-financed retirement benefit
will not count as service for severance pay purposes.

Rate of payment: severance benefit
250. For the purpose of calculating any payment under clause 244, salary will include:
(i)
the employee's salary
(ii) higher duties allowance, where the employee has been receiving the
allowance for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately
preceding the date on which the employee is given notice of termination
(iii) other allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of
annual leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Page 28

reimbursement for expenses incurred, or a payment for disabilities
associated with the performance of duty.

Retention periods
251. An employee who is offered voluntary retrenchment and does not accept the
offer will be involuntarily terminated by the Director under section 29 of the
Public Service Act 1999 after the following relevant retention period has elapsed:
(i)
13 months where an employee has 20 or more years of service or is over
45 years of age
(ii) seven months for other employees.
252. If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, the retention
period in the preceding clause will be reduced by the number of weeks’
redundancy pay that the employee will be entitled to under the NES on
termination, calculated as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by
this clause).
253. An employee who has rejected voluntary retrenchment in favour of serving the
relevant retention period will not be entitled to payment of a severance benefit
(other than the employee’s NES entitlement to redundancy pay and any balance
left on the retention period in accordance with clause 259).
254. The Director will not terminate the employment of an excess employee where the
employee has not been made a written offer of voluntary retrenchment as per
clause 239 or has elected to be voluntarily retrenched but the Director has refused
to approve it.
255. The retention period will commence on the earlier of the following:
(i)
the day the employee is advised in writing by the Director that he or she is
an excess employee
(ii) one month after the day on which the Director makes a written offer of
voluntary retrenchment to the employee.
256. During the retention period the Director:
(i)
will continue to take reasonable steps to find alternative employment for
the excess employee
(ii) may, with four weeks' notice, reduce the excess employee's classification as
a means of securing alternative employment for the excess employee.
Where an excess employee is reduced in classification before the end of the
appropriate retention period, the employee will continue to be paid at their
previous level for the balance of the retention period.
257. If requested by the excess employee, the Institute will meet reasonable travel and
incidental expenses incurred exclusively for the purpose of seeking alternative
employment in Australia, where these are not met by the prospective employer.
258. The retention periods specified in clause 251 and the notice period specified in
clause 261 will be extended by any periods of Personal Leave supported by
medical evidence which is taken during these periods, up to a maximum of 18
days.
259. Where the Director believes there is insufficient productive work available for an
excess employee within the agency during the retention period and that there is
no reasonable redeployment prospects in the APS, the Director may (subject to
clause 260) terminate the employee’s employment under section 29 of the Public
Service Act 1999 and pay the balance of the retention period as a lump sum
comprising:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 29

(i)

the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the NES under clause
252) and this payment will be taken to include payment in lieu of notice of
termination of employment
(ii) the employee’s NES entitlement to redundancy pay.
260. Except, where agreed by the employee, the employee’s employment will not be
terminated within three months of the start of the retention period.
261. The excess employee will be given four weeks’ notice (or five weeks’ notice for an
employee over 45 years with at least five years of continuous service). The
specified period of notice will, as far as practicable, be concurrent with the
retention periods.

Section 8 – Dispute resolution
Dispute prevention and settlement procedures
262. If a dispute relates to a matter arising under this agreement or the NES, the
parties to the dispute must attempt to resolve the matter at the workplace level by
discussions between the employee or employees concerned and the relevant
supervisor/manager and/or senior managers.
263. The parties to the dispute may appoint another person, organisation or
association to accompany and/or represent them for the purposes of this
provision.
264. If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the
dispute may refer the matter to the Fair Work Commission.
265. The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in two stages:
(i)
The Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it
considers appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an
opinion or making a recommendation.
(ii) If the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first
stage, Fair Work Australia may then:
a. arbitrate the dispute
b. make a determination that is binding on the parties.
266. If the Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers
that are available to it under the Fair Work Act 2009.
267. A decision that the Fair Work Commission makes when arbitrating a dispute is a
decision for the purpose of Division 3 of Part 5.1 of the Fair Work Act 2009.
Therefore, an appeal may be made against the decision.
268. While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this
term, an employee must continue to perform his or her work as he or she would
normally unless he or she has a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his
or her health or safety. Employees must comply with any direction given by the
Director to perform other available work at the same workplace, or at another
workplace, unless:
(i)
the work is not safe
(ii) applicable workplace health and safety legislation would not permit the
work to be performed
(iii) the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform
(iv) there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.
269. The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair Work
Commission in accordance with this term.

Review of employment actions
270. Where a disagreement arises over decisions or actions affecting an employee’s
APS employment, s/he may seek a review in accordance with the Public Service
Act.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Enterprise Agreement 2016
Page 31

271. The sole and exhaustive rights and remedies of an employee in relation to
termination of employment are those that the employee has under legislation and
at common law.
272. Termination of employment, or a decision to terminate employment, cannot be
reviewed under the Dispute prevention and settlement procedures of this
Agreement.
273. Nothing in this agreement prevents the Director from terminating the
employment of an employee for serious misconduct, without further notice or
payment in lieu, in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009, subject to compliance
with the procedures established by the Director for determining whether an
employee has breached the Code of Conduct.
