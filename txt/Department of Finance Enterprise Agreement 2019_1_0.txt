restriction duties in unforeseen circumstances for another employee on rostered
arrangements, or on a short-term roster arrangement, will receive a restriction
allowance of $186 for each day of restriction.

It is not expected that an employee will be restricted for more than the maximum
number of days specified in the table above. However where this occurs, the
delegate may determine an additional payment to recompense the employee for the
additional restriction.

i.

the FWC will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate,
including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a
recommendation; and

if the FWC is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the FWC may
then:
•
•

arbitrate the dispute; and
make a determination that is binding on the parties.

f)

If the FWC arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available to it
under the FW Act.

g)

A decision that the FWC makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for the
purpose of Division 3 of Part 5.1 of the FW Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made
against the decision.

h)

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this term:
i.

an employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally
unless they have a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health
or safety; and

an employee must comply with a direction given by the employer to perform
other available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:

34

•
•
•
•

the work is not safe;
applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the
work to be performed;
the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or
there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the FWC in
accordance with this term.

total paid hours being less than five hours, the driver will be paid a total of five hours
for that period.
c)

but are not limited to, official visits, natural disasters, extraordinary Parliamentary
sessions, and events of national security.

b)

When requested to work on any given day, a casual driver will be called in and paid
for a minimum of three hours.

33.3

Notification of cancellation of shift

When possible, drivers will be notified of any shift cancellations with a minimum of three
hours notice, prior to the advised start time. Notification of a shift cancellation without this
minimum notice will result in the driver being paid the minimum hour provisions as specified
in clause 33.2. The shift cancellation payment will only apply where the driver then does not
work on the day in question, unless otherwise determined by the delegate.

34

Ongoing drivers

Clauses 34.1 – 34.20 apply to ongoing drivers only. Ongoing drivers may be employed on a
full-time or part-time basis.
34.1

Home garaging

Full-time drivers may drive a fleet vehicle to and from their place of residence at the
beginning and end of each period of duty. Part time drivers will not be entitled to this
arrangement.
34.2

Biannual cycle – ongoing drivers

A biannual cycle will operate for ongoing drivers and be based on the established principle of
a 38 hour week (or pro rata for part-time drivers) and an average reasonable additional
hours overtime component of two hours per week (or pro rata for part-time drivers). The
period of the biannual cycles will be:
1st cycle
2nd cycle

1 January – 30 June
1 July – 31 December

37

34.3

Biannual cycle hours

a)

Each full-time driver, with the exception of dedicated drivers, will be required to work
1040 hours in each cycle (pro rata for part-time drivers).

b)

Part-time drivers may be required to perform reasonable administrative or other
non-driving tasks from time to time in order to fulfil the biannual cycle hours.

34.4

No financial adjustment if insufficient work available

Where a driver has worked all hours nominated but not worked the required hours applicable
as described in clause 34.3, no financial adjustment will apply.
34.5

Excess hours in a cycle

a)

At the request of the delegate, an ongoing driver may exceed the maximum number
of hours worked within the biannual cycle.

b)

Where a full-time driver exceeds the applicable hours within any biannual
reconciliation period as defined in clause 34.2 and 34.3, the driver will have the
option of either payment for excess hours at the normal hourly rate (base salary,
inclusive of allowances received) or time off in lieu, or a combination thereof. Where
a part-time driver exceeds the applicable hours within a biannual reconciliation period
as defined above, the driver will be paid for excess hours at the casual hourly rate.

c)

Payment for the excess hours worked, or time off in lieu where requested, will occur
as soon as possible after the end of each biannual period.

34.6

Minimum hours of duty

a)

An ongoing driver may be required to work on any day in the period with the
exception of relevant public holidays.

b)

Notwithstanding the above provisions, the delegate may require ongoing drivers to
perform duty in special circumstances. Special circumstances would include, but not
necessarily be limited to, official visits, natural disasters, extraordinary parliamentary
sessions, and events of national security.

c)

When required to work on any given day, an ongoing driver will be called in and
credited for a minimum of three hours.

34.7

Notification of cancellation of shift

When possible, ongoing drivers will be notified of any shift cancellations a minimum three
hours prior to the advised start time. Notification of a shift cancellation within these hours
prior to the commencement of duty will result in the ongoing driver being credited with the
minimum hour provisions as specified in clause 34.6. The shift cancellation credit will only
apply where the driver then does not work on the day in question, unless otherwise
determined by the delegate.
34.8

Rest days

a)

An ongoing driver will be entitled to a rest day on each Saturday and on each Sunday
which does not precede a parliamentary sitting period published in the parliamentary
sitting calendar. If an ongoing driver is required to work on one of these rest days,
they will receive a Scheduled Day Off (SDO) in lieu on a day suitable to operational
requirements.

b)

An ongoing driver will also be entitled to relevant public holidays in the jurisdiction in
which they work. COMCAR may request an ongoing driver to work on a particular
public holiday and for such work performed, the driver will be entitled to an SDO on a

38

day suitable to operational requirements. SDOs may be accumulated up to a
maximum balance at any one time of five days.
c)

A rest day is defined as a full calendar day where a driver is not required to perform
any duties.

d)

SDOs are non-accumulative except as specified above or under exceptional
circumstances where operational requirements prevent the driver from accessing
those scheduled days off.

34.9

Restrictions on taking annual leave

In accordance with COMCAR operational requirements, ongoing drivers employed in
Canberra are not permitted to take periods of annual leave exceeding one day during
parliamentary sitting periods (including the Sunday prior to a parliamentary sitting period
published in the parliamentary sitting calendar), given that these employees are employed to
complete their duties primarily during these specified periods.
34.10

Remuneration for ongoing drivers

a)

In recognition of the flexibilities relating to the continued practice of non-payment of
overtime and penalties, a National Flexibility Allowance as set out in Attachment A
will be paid to full-time ongoing drivers. A part-time driver may be required to
maintain either a 24 hours per day availability (except entitled rest days) or a 12
hours per day availability (except entitled rest days).

b)

The full National Flexibility Allowance will be paid to drivers required to maintain 24
hour availability, while 50 per cent of the National Flexibility Allowance will be paid to
drivers required to maintain 12 hours per day availability. The period of availability will
be agreed at the time of employment and may be varied by mutual agreement
between the driver and the delegate.

c)

The annual salary for a full-time ongoing driver will be as per Attachment A
(pro-rata for part-time drivers). The employee’s rate of salary will be salary for all
purposes. Specifically, where salary sacrifice arrangements (or other relevant
arrangements) are in place, the employee’s salary for purposes of superannuation,
severance and termination payments (or other purposes) will be determined as if the
salary sacrifice (or other) arrangement had not been entered into.

34.11 Special conditions applying to dedicated drivers
a)

From time to time the delegate may designate an ongoing driver to be a dedicated
driver, being dedicated to drive for a particular office holder until otherwise notified by
the delegate. The provisions outlined below apply to an ongoing driver for any period
whilst they are designated a dedicated driver.

b)

A dedicated driver may be appointed to drive office holders as determined by the
Parliament or Prime Minister of the day.

c)

Dedicated drivers will be eligible to receive a Dedicated Driver Allowance as per
Attachment A (pro-rata for part-time drivers).

d)

Dedicated drivers will operate under the biannual cycle except that the overtime
component will be seven hours per week, therefore the biannual cycle hours
required, subject to clause 34.12 will be 1118 (pro-rata for part-time drivers).

34.12 Excess hours within a cycle worked by dedicated drivers
a)

At the request of the delegate, a dedicated driver may exceed the maximum number
of hours worked within the cycle.

39

b)

Where a dedicated driver exceeds, or it appears they will exceed the applicable
hours as defined in clause 34.11 within any biannual reconciliation period as defined
in clause 34.2, the driver will have the option of either payment at the normal hourly
rate (base salary, inclusive of allowances received) or time off in lieu or a
combination thereof as soon as possible after the end of each biannual period.

c)

A dedicated driver will receive at least two weeks notice (or four weeks if they have
been performing the role for two or more years) in the event they cease to become a
dedicated driver. The dedicated driver allowance will cease at the expiration of the
notice period.

d)

A dedicated driver will be required to undertake pool work when not required by their
allocated entitlement.

e)

Where an ongoing driver relieves in the dedicated driver position, that driver will
receive the proportional daily rate of the Dedicated Driver Allowance for the days that
the relief is performed.

34.13 Excess ongoing drivers redundancy
a)

The provision of clauses 34.13 to 34.20 cover only ongoing drivers who are
employed as at the commencement of this Agreement. Ongoing drivers employed
after the commencement of this Agreement will be subject to clauses 30.1 to 30.10
covering redeployment and excess employees.

b)

For the purposes of these provisions, an ongoing driver is excess if:
i.

the driver is included in a class of employees employed by COMCAR, which
comprises a greater number of employees than is necessary for the efficient
and economical working of COMCAR;

ii.

the services of the ongoing driver cannot be effectively used because of
technological or other changes in the work methods, or changes in the nature,
extent or organisation of the functions of COMCAR; or

iii.

the ongoing driver’s work is to be performed on an ongoing basis in a different
geographic locality, they are not willing to relocate to that locality and the
delegate has determined that this definition applies to the ongoing driver.

34.14 Consultation process
a)

When the delegate is aware that an ongoing driver is likely to become excess, the
delegate will advise the driver of the situation and that they may choose to have a
representative present, which may include a union party to this Agreement.

b)

The delegate will hold discussions with the ongoing driver and/or where the driver
chooses, their representative, over a period not exceeding one month, to consider:

c)

i.

measures that could be taken to resolve the situation, including redeployment
at or below the driver’s classification level;

ii.

referral to a suitable redeployment agency; and

iii.

whether voluntary retrenchment might be appropriate.

The delegate will identify the ongoing driver who is excess to COMCAR's
requirements:
i.

after the discussions referred to above have been held; or

ii.

where the ongoing driver or their representative has declined to discuss the
matter, one month after the delegate had advised the ongoing driver; and

iii.

will immediately advise the ongoing driver in writing that they are excess.

40

d)

The delegate may, prior to the conclusion of these discussions, invite ongoing drivers
who are not excess to express an interest in voluntary retrenchment, where the
retrenchment of those drivers would permit the redeployment of drivers who are in a
redundancy situation.

e)

The delegate will then establish, through consultation with the identified driver/s,
whether they want to be offered voluntary retrenchment immediately or seek
redeployment. An ongoing driver seeking redeployment will be advised in writing that
they are excess (if this has not already occurred) and be immediately referred to a
suitable redeployment agency or program for redeployment assistance.

f)

The delegate will take all reasonable steps, consistent with the interests of the
efficient operation of COMCAR, to assign excess ongoing drivers to suitable
vacancies at the same classification level within COMCAR or Finance.

34.15 Voluntary retrenchment
a)

Where the delegate invites an excess ongoing driver to accept voluntary
retrenchment, the driver will have one month in which to accept the offer. Where the
offer is accepted, the delegate will not give notice of termination before the end of
that period, without the agreement of the driver.

b)

Within that month, an ongoing driver invited to accept voluntary retrenchment must
be given information on their entitlements, including:
i.

the amount of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice and paid up leave credits;

ii.

the amount of accumulated superannuation contributions;

iii.

the options concerning superannuation;

iv.

the taxation rules applying to the various payments; and

v.

that there is assistance, up to a maximum of $1,000, for financial advice.

c)

The delegate may make an offer of voluntary retrenchment to an excess ongoing
driver within two months of action being taken under clause 34.14 for redeployment
and, if not already made, will usually make an offer at the end of that period to any
ongoing driver who has not been redeployed.

d)

Only one offer of voluntary retrenchment will be made to an excess ongoing driver.

e)

An excess ongoing driver who declines an offer of voluntary retrenchment or who
does not accept the offer within the one month period will immediately be referred to
a suitable redeployment agency or program for redeployment assistance.

34.16 Period of notice
a)

Where the excess ongoing driver agrees to be voluntarily retrenched, the delegate
may retrench the ongoing driver by giving the required notice of termination under
section 29 of the PS Act. The period of notice will be four weeks (or five weeks for a
driver over 45 years of age with at least five years of continuous service).

b)

Where an ongoing driver terminates or is terminated at the beginning of or within the
notice period, the ongoing driver will receive payment in lieu of notice for the
unexpired portion of the notice period.

34.17 Severance benefit
a)

Ongoing drivers who agree to be retrenched and whose employment is terminated by
the delegate under section 29(3)(a) of the PS Act on the grounds that they are
excess to requirements are entitled to be paid a sum equal to two weeks salary for
each completed year of continuous service, plus a pro-rata payment for completed

41

months of service since the last completed year of service, subject to any minimum
amount the driver is entitled to under the National Employment Standards.
b)

The minimum sum payable will be four weeks salary and the maximum will be 48
weeks salary.

c)

The severance benefit will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period worked
part time, if the driver has less than 24 years full-time service.

d)

Service for severance pay purposes means:
i.

service in Finance;

ii.

government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976;

iii.

service with a Commonwealth body (other than service with a joint
Commonwealth-State body corporate) in which the Commonwealth has a
controlling interest which is recognised for long service leave purposes;

iv.

service with the Australian Defence Forces;

v.

APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under repealed
section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922, if the service has not previously been
recognised for severance pay purposes;

vi.

service in another organisation (excluding the ACT Public Service) where:
•
•

an employee moved from the APS to that organisation with a transfer of
function;
an employee engaged by that organisation on work within a function is
engaged in the APS as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS;

such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.
vii.

ACT Public Service for persons who were compulsorily transferred to the ACT
Public Service on its establishment as a separate service on 1 July 1994 and
who subsequently rejoined the APS.

viii.

For earlier periods of service to count there must be no breaks between the
periods of service, except where:
•
•

e)

the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of
employment with the new employer was made and accepted by the
employee before ceasing employment with the preceding employer; or
the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the
employee was deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under
repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922.

Any period of service, which ceased:
i.

through termination on the following grounds, or on a ground equivalent to any
of the following grounds:
•
•
•
•
•
•

ii.

the employee lacks, or has lost, an essential qualification for performing
their duties;
non-performance, or unsatisfactory performance, of duties;
inability to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity;
failure to satisfactorily complete an entry level training course;
failure to meet a condition imposed under section 22(6) of the PS Act; or
a breach of the Code of Conduct.

on a ground equivalent to a ground listed in subparagraph (iv) above, under the
repealed Public Service Act 1922; or

42

iii.

through voluntary termination at or above the minimum retiring age applicable
to the employee; or

iv.

with the payment of a redundancy benefit or similar payment or an
employer-financed retirement/termination benefit;

will not count as service for severance pay purposes.
f)

Absences from work which do not count as service for long service leave purposes
will not count as service for severance pay purposes.

g)

COMCAR is bound by the rules governing re-engagement by an Australian
Government agency of an ex-APS or ex-Parliamentary Service Act employee who
has received a redundancy benefit.

34.18 Rate of payment – severance benefit
For the purpose of calculating any payment under clause 34.17, salary will include:
i.

the driver’s full time salary, adjusted on a pro-rata basis for periods of
part-time service; and

ii.

ongoing allowances paid under this agreement including National Flexibility
Allowance and Dedicated Driver Allowance.

34.19 Retention periods
a)

b)

c)

An excess ongoing driver who does not accept an offer of voluntary retrenchment will
not be involuntarily terminated without their agreement until the following retention
periods have elapsed:
i.

thirteen months where they have 20 or more years of service or are over 45
years of age; or

ii.

seven months for other drivers.

The retention period will commence on the earlier of:
i.

the day the driver is advised in writing by the delegate that they are an excess
ongoing driver under clause 34.14; or

ii.

one calendar month after the day on which the delegate invites the ongoing
driver to accept voluntary retrenchment under clause 34.14.

During the retention period, the delegate:
i.
ii.

will continue to take reasonable steps to find alternative employment for the
excess ongoing driver; and
may, with four weeks notice, assign the excess ongoing driver to duties with a
lower classification, but where this occurs before the end of the retention
period, the driver will receive income maintenance to maintain their salary at
the previous higher classification for the balance of the retention period.

d)

The excess ongoing driver may request assistance in meeting reasonable travel and
incidental expenses, where these are not met by the prospective employer, incurred
seeking alternative employment and/or in moving residence to take up alternative
employment.

e)

Where:
i.

an excess ongoing driver has been receiving redeployment assistance for two
months; and

ii.

the redeployment agency certifies that there is no reasonable prospect of
redeployment in the APS; and

43

iii.

the delegate is satisfied that there is insufficient productive work available for
them in COMCAR during the remainder of their retention period;

iv.

the delegate may, with the agreement of the ongoing driver, terminate their
employment under section 29 of the PS Act and pay the balance of the
retention period as a lump sum, and this payment will be taken to include the
payment in lieu of notice of termination.

f)

If an ongoing driver is entitled to a redundancy payment under the National
Employment Standards, the relevant retention period set out in this clause will be
reduced by the driver’s redundancy pay entitlement under the National Employment
Standards on termination, calculated as at the expiration of the retention period (as
adjusted by this clause).

g)

Upon termination the driver will be paid a lump sum comprising:
i.

the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the National Employment
Standards under this clause) and this payment will be taken to include the
payment in lieu of notice of termination of employment; plus

ii.

the driver’s National Employment Standards entitlement to redundancy pay.

34.20 Involuntary termination
a)

Subject to clause 34.15, the delegate may involuntarily terminate the employment of
an excess ongoing driver under section 29 of the PS Act at the end of the retention
period.

b)

An excess ongoing driver will not be terminated involuntarily if they have not been
invited to accept an offer of voluntary retrenchment or have elected to be terminated
but the delegate or their delegate has refused to approve it.

c)

An excess ongoing driver will not be terminated involuntarily without being given four
weeks notice (or five weeks notice if they are over 45 with at least five years of
continuous service) of termination, or payment in lieu of notice, and this period of
notice will, as far as practicable, be within the retention period outlined in clause
34.19.
