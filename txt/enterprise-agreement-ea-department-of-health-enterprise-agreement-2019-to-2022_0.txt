Australian National University or a comparable course in Australia, or
iii. the employee has gained experience which, in the opinion of the Secretary, is
equivalent to the experience of a person who has satisfied (i) or (ii).
Superannuation
Employer Superannuation Contributions
35)
An employee will receive compulsory employer superannuation contributions as
required by the applicable legislation and fund requirements. The salary for superannuation
purposes for PSSap members will be calculated based on the employee’s ordinary time
earnings (OTE).
Superannuation choice
36)
Where an employee has chosen an accumulation superannuation fund, other than
PSSap, the employer contribution will be 15.4% of the OTE. This will not be reduced by any
other contributions made through salary sacrifice arrangements or during period of paid
parental leave (however described). This clause does not apply where a superannuation
fund cannot accept employer superannuation contributions (e.g. unable to accept
contributions for people aged over 75).
37)
For the purposes of this agreement, OTE is the salary paid for an employee’s regular
hours of work, not including overtime. It includes over-award payments, shift allowances,
commissions and paid leave up to the maximum contributions base for the quarter. Where
salary sacrifice arrangements are in place or the employee is on paid maternity, adoption or
foster leave, employer contributions will be paid as if those arrangements had not been
entered into.
Page 16

38)
Employer superannuation contributions will not be paid on behalf of employees
during periods of unpaid leave not to count as service, unless otherwise required under
legislation.
39)
The Secretary may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying
superannuation funds that allow an employee and/or employer contributions to be paid
through fortnightly electronic funds transfer using a file generated by the department’s
payroll system.
Treatment of allowances
40)
A table indicating the treatment of allowances for superannuation purposes is at
Attachment B.
Salary packaging
41)
Employees may access salary packaging, and may package up to one hundred per
cent of salary. Where an employee takes up the option of salary packaging, the employee's
salary for purposes of superannuation, severance and termination payments, and any other
purposes, will be determined as if the salary packaging arrangement had not occurred.
42)
Any fringe benefits tax incurred by individual employees as a result of salary
packaging arrangements will be met by the individual employee on a salary sacrifice basis.
Further information on salary packaging is available in the Salary Packaging policy.

Page 22

PART E – HOURS OF WORK AND FLEXIBILITY
Hours of work
79)
All employees have a mutual responsibility for managing their working hours and
patterns, including leave planning, flextime arrangements, breaks, and minimising additional
hours where possible. The provisions below are designed to be sufficiently flexible for
employees to meet business requirements and balance their personal needs.
80)
An employee and their Manager will work together to manage hours of work and
breaks to ensure that an employee is not working excessive hours without the opportunity
to take time off either as flextime (for APS1-6 and their equivalents) or in the case of
Executive Level employees (and their equivalents), as Executive Level time off.
81)
All employees have access to flexible working hours. For APS1-6 (and their
equivalents), these flexible working hours will be accessed through the flextime scheme.
82)
For the purposes of calculating pay, attendance and flextime, ordinary hours of work
for full-time employees is 150 hours over the four week settlement period commencing on a
payday Thursday. This equates to an average of 7 hours 30 minutes per day.
Further information is available in the Hours of work and flexibility policy.
Standard Day
83)
The Standard Day is used for the purposes of determining a full-time employee’s
hourly rate of pay, overtime entitlements, the accrual and deduction of leave and
calculation of hours over the flextime period.
84)
The Standard Day for full-time employees is 7 hours and 30 minutes worked from
8.30am to 12.30pm and 1.30pm to 5.00pm Monday to Friday.
85)

An employee’s attendance pattern will be a Standard Day where:
a) essential operational requirements and the availability of work require that
hours worked are temporarily varied, including reversion to a standard day, or
b) an employee’s attendance is unsatisfactory or that the employee is misusing
flextime.

Hours of work of part-time employees
86)
For part-time employees, ordinary hours are those agreed in the employee’s parttime work agreement within the provisions of clauses 137 and 138.
Working patterns
87)
The pattern of hours by which an employee meets their ordinary hours of duty will
be determined in consultation with the employee, and with regard to the operational needs
of the department. An employee will not normally be required to:
a) work more than 10 hours ordinary time on any day, or
b) commence work on any day without having at least 10 hours minimum break
from the previous day’s work, without specific approval from their manager.

Page 23

88)
Where this does occur, the overtime and time in lieu provisions at clauses 112 to 123
and/or meal allowance provisions at clauses 69 and 70 may apply.
89)
Regardless of the bandwidth, APS employees are required to take an unpaid break of
at least 30 minutes for every five hours of work.
Insufficient work and flextime
90)
Working extended hours is subject to work availability and manager approval. Over a
four week settlement period, a manager may require an employee not to work hours in
excess of their ordinary hours where there is insufficient available productive work to
warrant working the extended hours.
Bandwidth
91)
The bandwidth of hours in which an employee will work their ordinary hours is 7.00
am to 7.00 pm, Monday to Friday.
Work outside bandwidth
92)
Where an employee requests to work their ordinary hours outside the bandwidth
e.g. on Saturday or Sunday, the employee may do so, subject to operational requirements,
with the agreement of their manager. Any hours worked on this basis will be considered
ordinary hours and will not attract overtime. Variation of the bandwidth hours can be on a
regular, temporary or intermittent basis.
After hours use of taxis
93)
A Manager may approve the use of taxis by an employee for after hours work, as
part of their overall WHS responsibility.
Recording attendance
94)
All employees are required to record their working hours.
Further information is available in the Hours of work and flexibility policy.
Flextime scheme
APS1-6 (and their equivalents)
95)
APS1-6 employees (and their equivalents) accumulate flextime for duty performed in
excess of their ordinary hours of work (over the settlement period), that does not attract
overtime.
96)

Subject to the agreement of their manager, an employee may:
a) vary their pattern of attendance from time to time in order to meet personal
needs,
b) take flextime as a part or whole day absence.

Excess flex credits
97)
Where an employee’s flex credit exceeds 20 hours at the end of a settlement period,
the employee and their manager will put a plan in place to reduce the flex credits.

Page 24

Cash out of credits exceeding 30 hours
98)
At the end of a settlement period, an employee’s manager may approve flex credits
exceeding 30 hours to be cashed out at ordinary time rates where, due to organisational
requirements, the manager cannot envisage an opportunity for the employee to use those
credits in the next settlement period.
Cash out of credits exceeding 37.5 hours
99)
At the request of the employee, flex credits exceeding 37.5 hours can be cashed out.
Flex debit balance
100) Employees may carry over a maximum of 10 hours flex debit accumulated in any
settlement period into the next settlement period. If the maximum debit is exceeded at the
end of a settlement period and is not reduced to the maximum allowable (or lower) over
the next settlement period, the amount by which the maximum is exceeded shall be treated
as leave without pay and an appropriate deduction made from the employee’s salary in
accordance with the Accountable Authority Instructions.
Flex balances at cessation
101) Prior to cessation of employment, the employee’s manager should provide
opportunities to enable the employee to balance any flex credits or debits. Employees
should also take all reasonable steps to balance their flex debit or credit. Where flex credits
are outstanding at the cessation of employment with the department, the flex credit will be
paid to the employee at ordinary time rates. Where flex debits are outstanding at the
cessation, these will be recovered as part of the termination payment, in accordance with
the Accountable Authority Instructions and the FW Act.
Additional hours
102) In accordance with the FW Act, an employee may refuse to work additional hours
(extra hours or directed overtime) where such additional hours are unreasonable. Such
refusal will not prejudice the employee’s employment. For the purposes of this clause,
additional hours are those in excess of:
a) 37.5 hours per week for a full-time employee, or
b) the agreed ordinary hours of work per week for a part-time employee.
Executive Level time off
103) The department recognises the focus on the achievement of outcomes by Executive
Level employees (and their equivalents) as senior professionals of the department. The
achievement of organisational outcomes may involve considerable work effort, variable
work hours and on occasions a requirement to work over and above normal working hours.
The department recognises these efforts and contributions.
104) Executive Level employees and their managers will work together to manage
workloads and working hours, including making arrangements as to when any Executive
Level time off will be taken.

Page 25

105) Where operational needs require an Executive Level employee to work additional
hours in excess of their ordinary hours for a sustained period, including a critical incident
response, the employee and their manager will agree and document arrangements for time
off to recognise the additional effort.
106) To minimise any negative impact on an employee’s health and wellbeing, Executive
Level time off should be taken as soon as practical, subject to operational requirements.
107) Time off for Executive Level employees is available on an hour for hour basis for
official domestic travel only. All other Executive Level time off will not be on an hour for
hour basis.
108) Regardless of the bandwidth, Executive Level employees are required to break for at
least 30 minutes after five hours of continuous work.
Time off for official travel
109) Executive Level employees will only receive Executive Level time off on an hour-forhour basis for time spent on official domestic travel outside of the Standard Day, excluding
the usual time taken for the employee to travel to and from their regular place of work.
Existing local travel arrangements for international travel will continue to apply.
110) To minimise any negative impact on an Executive Level employee’s personal
commitments, wherever possible the department encourages employees to travel within
the bandwidth.
National Incident Room (NIR)
111) The Secretary will specify mandatory breaks for periods of extended duty by
employees working in the NIR during an incident response. Mandated rest periods shall be
provided as full days. NIR duties in excess of five continuous days of increased hours shall
attract no less than two consecutive days, free of all duty, immediately following the
Incident.
Overtime
APS1-6 (and their equivalents)
112) APS1-6 level employees (and their equivalents) are eligible for an overtime payment
where they are required by the Secretary to:
a) perform work outside the bandwidth (inclusive of weekends and public holidays),
or
b) work in excess of 9.5 hours on any one day (Monday to Friday inclusive),
whichever occurs first.
Part-time employees - APS1-6 (and their equivalents)
113) In addition to clause 112, part-time employees at the APS1-6 level (and their
equivalents) are eligible for overtime for work performed at the direction of the Secretary,
which is:
a) not continuous with the employee’s agreed or specified hours of work, and/or
b) beyond the total ordinary hours of work over the settlement period specified in
the employee’s part-time work agreement.
Page 26

114) Subject to clause 113, a part-time employee will be eligible for overtime for work
performed in excess of the agreed hours of duty over the settlement period, unless they
elect to receive those additional hours as Time in Lieu under clause 117.
Executive Level (and their equivalents)
115) Executive Level employees (and their equivalents) are not generally entitled to
payment for overtime. However, the Secretary may approve overtime for Executive Level
employees in exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, the time off provisions in clauses 103
to 110 will apply.
Travel not to count
116) Time spent travelling to or from work will not count as part of an overtime
attendance.
Time in lieu (TIL)
117) If an employee chooses, the Secretary may allow the employee to take TIL as a form
of recompense for overtime as an alternative to overtime payment, subject to the
provisions of this clause.
Calculation
118) Where overtime is worked, the rate of payment (or TIL, if the employee elects) is
calculated at the following rates:
a) Monday to Saturday: time-and-a-half
b) Sunday: double-time.
Public holidays
119) An employee who is directed to work overtime on a public holiday which falls on a
weekday, will be paid overtime at double-time for duty outside of a Standard Day (for fulltime employees) or the agreed pattern of hours (for part-time employees). This rate also
applies to Easter Saturday if it is not declared or prescribed as a public holiday. For duty
within a Standard Day (or agreed pattern of hours for part-time employees), overtime will
be paid at single-time as employees are already being paid for the public holiday.
120) Employees required to perform overtime during the annual closedown will be
recompensed with overtime calculated at time-and-a-half.
Non-continuous duty
121) Where a period of overtime is not continuous with ordinary duty, the minimum
overtime payment is four hours at the relevant rate. Where the period of overtime is
greater than four hours, payment will be made for the actual period worked at the relevant
rate.
Continuous duty
122) Overtime is considered to be continuous with ordinary duty when an employee does
not have a break, other than a meal break, between the periods of ordinary duty and
overtime.

Page 27

Multiple attendance
123) Where more than one attendance is required, the minimum overtime payment
provision will not operate to increase an employee’s overtime payment beyond that which
they would have received had they remained on duty from the commencing time of duty on
one attendance, to the ceasing time of duty on a subsequent attendance.
Further information on overtime and TIL is available in the Hours of Work and Flexibility
policy.
Family care assistance
124) Where an employee is required by the department to be away from home outside
the employee’s Standard Day, and the employee incurs reasonable additional costs for
family care arrangements, the employee will be reimbursed those reasonable additional
costs.
Further information is available in the Family care assistance policy.
Public holidays
125) Public holidays will be observed in accordance with the National Employment
Standards (NES) and the FW Act.

i) any other day or part-day declared or prescribed by or under a law of a State or
Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory (or a region of the

127) The Secretary and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day or part-day
that would otherwise be a public holiday, having regard to operational requirements.
128) An employee, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a Public Holiday in the place
where the employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid for the part or full
day absence as if that day or part-day was not a Public Holiday, except where the Employee
would not normally have worked on that day.
129) Where a Public Holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on leave
(other than Annual or paid Personal/carers Leave) there is no entitlement to receive
payment as a Public Holiday. Payment for that day would be in accordance with the

Page 28

entitlement for that form of leave (e.g. if on Long Service Leave on half pay, payment is on
half pay).
Annual closedown and early stand down
130) The department will be closed for normal business and employees will not be
required to perform normal duty on the working days between Christmas Day and New
Year’s Day. Eligible employees will be paid for closedown. Pay eligibility for annual
closedown will be treated in the same manner as public holidays in determining the
appropriate rate of salary payment to apply on those days.
131) Where an employee is absent on leave, payment for the Christmas closedown
provision will be in accordance with the entitlement for that form of leave (e.g. if on long
service leave half-pay, payment is at half-pay).
132) There will be no deduction from annual or personal/carers leave credits for the
annual closedown days.
133) The department will be closed for normal business and employees will not be
required to perform duty from 3.00 pm on the working day prior to Christmas and the
working day prior to Good Friday. Eligible employees will be paid for their ordinary hours.
Payment eligibility will be treated in the same manner as a normal working day.
Flexible work arrangements
134) Access to flexible work arrangements will be in accordance with the NES and the
FW Act.
135) The Secretary will make every reasonable effort to accommodate requests for an
employee’s proposed part-time work hours when returning from maternity, adoption,
fostering or parental leave for the period up until the child’s second birthday, or in the case
of adoption and eligible fostering, the second anniversary of the placement.
136) Reasons for non-approval of the employee’s proposed part-time work hours must be
provided in writing to the employee, including reasons relating to operational requirements.
Part-time work
Hours of work for part-time
137) Payment and conditions for part-time employees will be calculated on a pro-rata
basis, apart from expense related allowances, where a part-time employee will receive the
same amount as a full-time employee.
Variation in hours for part-time
138) A part-time employee may not vary their hours for a period of one week or less.
Changes in hours for these periods should be accommodated using flextime or alternative
arrangements as agreed with their manager. Details of the operation of the flextime
provisions for part-time employees are provided at clauses 95 to 101.
Further information on part-time work provisions is available in the Hours of Work and
Flexibility policy.

Recall to duty
150) Where an employee is recalled from approved leave or that approved leave is
cancelled, the Secretary will approve reasonable reimbursement toward travel expenses
which have been incurred, incidental expenses or family care costs not otherwise
recoverable under insurance or from another source, provided that the employee took
reasonable precautions, as determined by the Secretary, to avoid such expenses.
School holiday family care subsidy
151) Where an employee with school children has leave refused, has approved leave
cancelled or is required to return from leave early because of departmental business
requirements during school holidays, the Secretary will reimburse up to $22 per child per
day of the amount paid by the employee for each school child attending approved or
registered care.
152) In the circumstances described above, where the employee can demonstrate that
they would otherwise have taken personal responsibility for caring for other family
members during school holidays, the Secretary may reimburse some, or all, of the amount
paid by the employee for that family care.
153) The reimbursement will be net of any government subsidy available to the
employee.
Further information on family care assistance and the school holiday family care subsidy is
available in the Family Care Assistance policy.

Portability of leave
154) Where an ongoing APS employee moves (including on promotion or for an agreed
period) from another agency, the employee’s unused accrued annual leave and
personal/carers leave (however described) will be recognised, provided there is no break in
continuity of service.
155) Where an employee is engaged as either an ongoing or non-ongoing APS employee
immediately following a period of employment under the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 or
the ACT Government Service, the employee’s unused accrued annual leave and
personal/carers leave (however described) will be transferred.
Former non-ongoing employees
156) Where a person is engaged as an ongoing employee, and immediately prior to the
engagement the person was employed as a non-ongoing APS employee, the Secretary, at
the employee’s request, may recognise any accrued annual leave and personal/carers leave
(however described), provided there is no break in continuity of service. Any recognised
annual leave excludes any accrued leave paid out on separation.
Annual leave
Entitlement
157) Full-time employees are entitled to the equivalent of 4 weeks per year of service.
Part-time employees accrue annual leave on a pro-rata basis for ordinary hours worked.
Annual leave will accrue daily.
158)

Employees working in a remote locality may have additional annual leave.

Further information is available in the Remote Locality policy.
Effect of leave without pay
159) Where ‘leave without pay not to count as service’ has been granted, annual leave
will be adjusted as follows:
a) Where aggregated absences are for periods totalling 30 calendar days or less, the
annual leave accrual is not affected.
b) Where aggregated absences total more than 30 calendar days, the total period of
leave without pay is deducted from the number of calendar days to count as
service.
c) Where leave without pay covers an entire calendar year, no annual leave credit
accrues for that year.
Direction to take annual leave
160) The Secretary may direct an employee who has more than two years annual leave
credit to take annual leave. The employee must take annual leave if directed to do so. The
employee may be directed to be on leave (and to be absent from the workplace) for 10
consecutive working days.
Deferring leave
161) An employee may apply to the Secretary to defer taking the leave defined in clause
160 for up to one year from an agreed date.
Page 33

162)

An employee with an annual leave credit greater than two years on:
a) commencing duty in the department, or
b) returning to work following a long term absence due to illness or injury, or
c) resuming duty following a graduated return to work,
will have a period of 12 months to take sufficient leave to reduce the employee’s credit
down to the equivalent of two years or less.
Annual leave at half-pay
163) Employees may take annual leave at half-pay. The minimum absence of leave on
half-pay is two working days, with further absences in multiples of two days. Where annual
leave is taken at half-pay, credits will be deducted from the employee’s annual leave
balance on the basis that two days of annual leave at half-pay is equivalent to one day of
annual leave at full-pay.
Payment of annual leave on termination
164) Any unused accrued annual leave will be subject to payment to the employee when
the employee’s APS employment is terminated. Payment will be calculated using the
employee’s final rate of salary, including allowances that would have been included in the
employee's pay during a period of annual leave.
165) For employees in remote localities, district allowance will be included in the
calculation only for the component of the annual leave credit that accrued in the remote
locality.
Voluntary cash out of annual leave
166) The Secretary may approve an application by an employee to cash out a portion of
the employee’s accrued annual leave credits. To be eligible to cash out annual leave,
employee’s must:
a) Have taken at least 15 days, or an equivalent pro rata amount for part-time
employees, in the 12 months preceding the request to cash out leave; and
b) Have a remaining balance of at least 4 weeks, or an equivalent pro rata amount
for part-time employees, annual leave credit if the application is approved.
167)

The employee will be paid the full amount that would have been paid had the
employee taken the entitlement as leave.

168)

Each cashing out of a particular amount of Annual Leave must be by a separate
agreement in writing with the Secretary.

169)

The maximum amount of annual leave that may be cashed out in a 12 month period
is two weeks.

Personal/carers leave
170) On engagement, an ongoing employee will be credited with personal/carers leave of
18 days or the part-time equivalent. A further 18 days or the part-time equivalent will
accrue on completion of each 12 month period of service thereafter, without limit.

Page 34

Accrual and credits - non-ongoing employees
171) Full-time non-ongoing employees, other than irregular/intermittent employees, are
entitled to 18 days personal/carers leave (135 hours) per year or the part-time equivalent,
accruing daily.
Deferral of accrual
172) Where ‘leave without pay not to count as service’ has been granted in the accrual
year, personal/carers leave accrual will be deferred as follows.
a) Where aggregated full day absences total 30 calendar days or less, the accrual is
not affected.
b) Where aggregated full day absences total more than 30 calendar days, the
accrual date will be deferred by one calendar month for each 30 calendar day
period.
Unpaid carers leave – irregular/intermittent employees
173) Irregular/intermittent employees are entitled to two days unpaid personal leave for
caring purposes for each permissible occasion, subject to notifying the employee’s manager
and providing satisfactory evidence.
Advice to manager
174) An employee, where practicable, must personally advise the employee’s manager of
the employee’s absence or the employee’s intention to be absent as soon as possible.
Where the employee’s manager is not contactable, advising another employee in the
employee’s work team will suffice.
Use of personal/carers leave
175) Personal/carers leave gives employees access to paid leave, subject to available
credits, when they are absent for the following reasons:
a) where the employee is not fit for work because of a personal illness or injury
affecting the employee,
b) to provide care or support to a member of the employee’s family or the
employee’s household, who requires care or support because of a personal
illness or personal injury, affecting the member,
c) where a member of the employee’s family or the employee’s household is
affected by an unexpected emergency,
d) for compelling personal reasons of an unexpected, urgent and unpredictable
nature, or
e) to attend preventative health consultations for the employee and/or those in the
employee’s care.
Personal Leave must not be used for the purposes of d) and/or e) above if it would be
detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared to the National Employment
Standards under the FW Act.
Satisfactory evidence requirements
176) For periods of personal/carers leave, employees should provide evidence to their
manager that would satisfy a reasonable person that the leave was taken for a reason set
out in clause 175.
Page 35

177) An employee must provide satisfactory evidence to support applications for
personal/carers leave for more than three consecutive days.
178) If an employee takes 10 days personal/carers leave without satisfactory evidence in
a period of twelve months, then the employee must provide satisfactory evidence for any
further applications for personal/carers leave of any duration for the balance of the period
of 12 months, unless otherwise determined by the Secretary.
For the purpose of this clause, the 12 month period commences on the date determined to
be the employee’s anniversary for the purpose of accruing personal/carers leave.
179) Satisfactory evidence must be provided within 24 hours of the employee’s return to
work or another period that is reasonable in the circumstances.
Conversion to half-pay
180) The Secretary may approve the conversion of personal/carers leave to half-pay for
an employee for a specified absence of not less than two days. Where personal/carers leave
is taken at half-pay, credits will be deducted from the employee’s personal/carers leave
balance on the basis that two days of personal/carers leave at half-pay is equivalent to one
day of personal/carers leave at full-pay. Converting personal/carers leave to half-pay does
not increase the 10 days of personal/carers leave without satisfactory evidence requirement
in clauses 176-179.
Unpaid personal/carers leave
181) Where paid personal/carers leave credits are exhausted, an employee may apply for
personal/carers leave without pay. Unpaid personal leave to a total of 26 weeks in a 12
month period will count as service for all purposes. Any further periods of unpaid
personal/carers leave will not count as service, unless otherwise required by legislation.
Reappointment after invalidity retirement
182) If an employee’s APS employment is terminated on the grounds of invalidity, and the
employee is subsequently re-engaged as a result of action taken under the relevant
superannuation legislation, the employee is entitled to be credited with personal/carers
leave equal to the balance of the employee’s personal/carers leave at the time of
termination.
183)

An employee is unable to access personal/carers leave while on paid parental leave.

Payment on termination
184) Unused personal/carers leave will not be paid out on termination of employment.
Further information on personal/carers leave is available in the Personal/Carers Leave
policy.
Miscellaneous leave

be in the interests of the department.
Page 36

186)

Leave may be granted:
a) for the period requested or for another period,
b) with or without pay, and
c) subject to conditions.

187) Where exceptional circumstances affect an employee, the Secretary will consider
granting paid leave. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to, emergency
situations such as bushfires, floods, cyclones and earthquakes.
Further information is available in the Miscellaneous Leave Policy.
Not to count as service
188) Miscellaneous leave without pay will not count as service for any purpose, except as
required by legislation, with the following exceptions:
a) leave for personal and development training in the interests of the department,
b) leave for non-APS employment in the interests of the department.
For a) and b) to count as service, an employee must return to work in the APS at the
completion of the miscellaneous leave without pay period.
Service for the purposes of Long Service Leave is provided for by the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.
189) Leave accrued while on Miscellaneous leave without pay to count as service will be
offset by any relevant leave entitlements received in non-APS employment.
Leave for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees

Islander employees to participate in ceremonial activities and other cultural obligations. To
allow employees to meet obligations and participate in activities, the following leave
provisions are provided:
a) two days leave with pay each year to participate in cultural or ceremonial events,
including NAIDOC Week activities, and
b) three months unpaid leave each year to fulfil cultural obligations. This leave will not
count as service for any purpose.
Unauthorised absences
191) Periods of unauthorised absence do not count as service for any purpose. Where an
employee is absent from duty without approval, all pay and other benefits provided under
the Agreement (e.g. flextime) will cease to be available until the employee resumes duty or
is granted leave. Where flextime no longer applies, the employee will revert to the Standard
Day.
War service sick leave
192) Eligible employees will generally be granted war service sick leave while unfit for
duty because of a war-caused condition. A war-caused condition means an injury or disease
of an employee that has been accepted by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to be warcaused or Defence-caused within the meaning of relevant legislation. Eligible employees will
Page 37

accrue a credit of nine weeks on commencement in the APS and an annual credit of three
weeks for each year of APS service. Unused credits will accumulate to a maximum of nine
weeks.
Compassionate leave
193) Employees, other than irregular/intermittent employees, will be granted two days
paid compassionate leave on each occasion that a member of the employee’s family, or the
employee’s household:

b) sustains a personal injury that poses a serious threat to life, or
c) dies.
194) The employee may take the period of leave as a single period of two days or any
separate period on which the employee’s manager and employee agree.
195) The employee’s manager may require the employee to provide evidence in support
of the request for leave.
196) An irregular / intermittent employee is entitled to unpaid compassionate leave of up

dependent on the employee for care, support and attention. Any further periods of leave
for this purpose may be granted by the Secretary as miscellaneous leave with pay on a case
by case basis.
Further information on bereavement leave is available in the Compassionate and
Bereavement Leave policy.
Purchased leave
198) To assist employees in balancing work and life responsibilities, the department
provides a scheme where additional leave may be purchased. Purchasing additional leave is
not intended to be used to establish a different work pattern such as a regular reduction in
weekly hours.
199) Where a manager agrees that an employee may participate in the purchased leave
scheme, the employee may purchase from one to eight weeks purchased leave per year.
To count as service
200) Purchased leave will count as service for all purposes. The employee’s salary for
superannuation purposes continues to be their salary as if they had not purchased leave,

Page 38

noting that no superannuation will be payable while the employee is taking purchased
leave.
Further information is available in the Annual Leave, Long Service Leave, Purchased Leave
and Extended Purchased Leave policy.

or instructor of Cadets. For these purposes ‘Cadet Force’ means the Australian Navy Cadets,
Australian Army Cadets, or the Australian Air Force Cadets.
207) Defence Reserve leave counts as service for all purposes, except for unpaid leave to
undertake Continuous Full Time Service (CFTS). Unpaid leave for the purpose of CFTS counts
as service for all purposes except Annual leave accrual.
Community service leave
208) An eligible community service activity includes:
a) jury service (including attendance for the purpose of jury selection) that is
required by or under a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory, or
b) carrying out a volunteer emergency management activity (within the meaning of
section 109 (2) of the FW Act).

Page 39

209) In relation to jury service, the Secretary will approve paid community service
volunteer leave to enable an employee to attend court appearances as a juror. In this event,
the employee will continue to receive their normal salary subject to any payments of a
salary nature made to the employee by the court for jury service being signed over to the

international sporting event.
Further information on community service leave is available in the Community Service Leave
policy.
Long service leave
212) Long service leave (LSL) will accrue and be available to eligible employees in
accordance with the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. Absences
must be taken for a minimum of seven consecutive calendar days at full-pay or 14
consecutive calendar days at half-pay. The granting of such leave is subject to operational
requirements.

to 12 weeks paid maternity leave for eligible employees.
215) At the employee’s request, the Secretary will approve spreading the payment for the

service for any purpose.
Additional leave
216) An eligible employee will also receive an additional two weeks paid leave to be taken
immediately following the period of paid maternity leave provided for under the Maternity
Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973. The Secretary will approve spreading the
additional period over four weeks at a rate no less than half normal pay, however, leave
that extends beyond two weeks does not count as service for any purpose.
Additional unpaid parental leave
217) An employee who has completed at least 12 months of continuous service with the
APS immediately before making an application for twelve months unpaid parental leave (the
first period) to care for a new born or newly adopted or foster child may request, at the
completion of the first period, an additional period of unpaid parental leave of up to 12
months in accordance with the FW Act.
218) Taking unpaid parental leave does not prevent an eligible employee from accessing
other types of paid leave (other than paid personal/carers leave, compassionate,
bereavement leave, and community service leave) in accordance with the FW Act. If the
employee does so, the taking of the other paid leave does not break the continuity of the
period of unpaid parental leave.
219)

Unpaid parental leave does not count as service for any purpose.

Further information on parental leave is available in the Parental Leave policy.
Special maternity leave
220) Where an employee who has at least 12 months continuous service with the APS
experiences a pregnancy-related illness, or if the pregnancy ends within 28 weeks of the

237) Leave is available to employees experiencing family and domestic violence, or to
provide support to a member of their family who is experiencing family and domestic
violence. For the purposes of clauses 236 to 241, family and domestic violence has the same

239)

These provisions apply in addition to any entitlements available under the NES.

240) Where documentary evidence is required for absences related to family and
domestic violence, the supervisor and employee will discuss and agree on options. This may
include statements from the police, courts or a legal representative, or statutory
declarations.
241) Where an employee experiencing family and domestic violence does not feel

determination will specify the period for which the adjusted level will apply. This clause
does not apply to decisions made by the Secretary in relation to breaches of the Code of
Conduct or underperformance.
Higher duties allowance (HDA) recommendation
243) To be recommended for payment of HDA, an employee must have at least achieved
a satisfactory performance standard in the employee’s substantive position or above, under

otherwise certifies that the employee should fill the position, including for developmental
purposes.
244) Research Scientists and Legal Officers must have performed at greater than a
satisfactory standard.
Period of HDA attracting payment
245) Where an employee performs HDA for a continuous period of more than five
working days, HDA is payable from the first day of the period of acting.

working days at substantive level; or a broken pattern of higher duties consisting of more
than 5 working days as approved by the Secretary.
Level of payment
247) Where an employee is to be paid HDA, the employee will be paid at the increment
point determined by the Secretary, recognising that there is an opportunity for the
employee to be paid above the minimum increment point within the salary range of the
higher position. The increment point attained through salary advancement in previous
periods of HDA at that classification level will be at least maintained.
Payment for partial performance
248) Where the full duties of the position are not being undertaken, the employee and
the Secretary may agree to payment at a point in a classification below that of the higher
duties position.
Public holidays or leave
249) An employee on HDA who is granted paid leave or who observes a public holiday will
continue to receive HDA payment, having regard to the provisions of this section, during the
employee’s absence. HDA will not be paid beyond the date on which the employee would
have ceased the period of acting had the employee not been absent. Where the period of
leave is paid at less than full-pay, payment of HDA will be made on a pro-rata basis.

of an employee for serious misconduct, without further notice or payment in lieu, in
accordance with the FW Act subject to compliance with the procedures established by the
Secretary for determining whether an employee has breached the Code of Conduct under
section 13 of the PS Act.

resigned on the last working day prior to the public holiday.
Death of an employee
254) Where an employee dies whilst in employment, or the Secretary has directed that an
employee is presumed to have died on a particular date whilst in employment, the
Secretary will, subject to legal requirements, authorise the payment of the amount to which
the former employee would have been entitled had they ceased employment by resignation
or retirement. Long service leave credits will be paid out in accordance with the Long Service
Leave Act (Commonwealth Employees) 1976.

locality and the employee is not willing to perform those duties at the new
locality, and the Secretary has determined that the provisions of this clause may
apply to that employee.
Eligible employee
256) The provisions of this Part do not apply to non-ongoing employees, employees who
are on probation or employees who are still within the minimum employment period as
defined in the FW Act.
Secretary’s powers
257) The powers of the Secretary with regard to excess employees allow the Secretary to:
a) reassign duties to an employee within the department and determine the place
at which the duties are performed,
b) consider options for redeployment of the employee to another APS agency,
c) reduce the classification level of an employee on the grounds that the employee
is excess to the requirements of the department at the higher classification level,
d) terminate the employment of an ongoing employee on the grounds that the
employee is excess to the requirements of the department.
Timely advice
258) When the Secretary is aware that an employee is likely to become excess, the
Secretary will advise the employee at the earliest practicable time.
259)

The Secretary will hold discussions with the potentially excess employee to consider:
a) redeployment opportunities for the employee concerned, and
b) whether voluntary retrenchment might be appropriate.

Referral to employee - initial consultation
260) Where an employee is identified as potentially excess, the Secretary will hold an
initial consultation with the employee and/or the employee’s representative.
261) During this initial consultation period of one month, unless the employee agrees to a
lesser period, the Secretary will not:
a) invite the employee to accept an offer of voluntary retrenchment, or
b) advise that employee in writing that they are excess.

Page 47

262) The Secretary may, prior to the conclusion of these discussions, invite employees
who are not potentially excess to express an interest in voluntary retrenchment, where
those retrenchments would permit the redeployment of employees who are potentially
excess. The Secretary will not advise an employee they are excess until the discussions
referred to in clause 259 have occurred.
Voluntary retrenchment
263) Where the Secretary invites an excess employee to elect to accept voluntary
retrenchment, the employee will have one month to accept or reject the invitation. The
Secretary will not give notice of termination under section 29 of the PS Act on the grounds
that the employee is excess to requirements, before the end of that period or until such
election is received (where the election is received before the end of that period).
Information to employee
264) At the time of inviting the employee to make an election, the Secretary will provide
the employee the following information:
a) the amounts of severance pay, payment in lieu of notice, and likely payment in
lieu of leave credits,
b) the amount of accumulated superannuation contributions,
c) the options open to the employee concerning superannuation, and
d) the taxation rules applying to the various payments.
Financial assistance
265) Employees considering voluntary retrenchment also have access to financial
assistance up to a total maximum of $477 (inclusive of GST) for financial counselling, and a
further $477 (inclusive of GST) for career counselling where such career counselling is not
otherwise provided through the department's external Employee Assistance Program.
Period of notice
266) Where an employee accepts an offer of voluntary retrenchment and the Secretary
approves the employee’s termination under section 29 of the PS Act, the Secretary will give
the employee a period of notice of four weeks, or five weeks for an employee over 45 years
of age with at least five years of continuous service.
Payment in lieu of notice
267) Where an employee retires or is retrenched at the beginning of, or within, the notice
period, they will receive payment in lieu of notice for the unexpired portion of the notice
period.
Severance benefit
268) Where an employee accepts an offer of voluntary retrenchment and the Secretary
terminates the employee’s employment under section 29 of the PS Act, the employee is
entitled to be paid a severance benefit of a sum equal to two weeks’ salary for each
completed year of service, plus a pro-rata payment for completed months of service since
the last completed year of service, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled
to under the FW Act and NES.

Page 48

269) The minimum sum payable will be four weeks’ salary and the maximum will be 48
weeks’ salary.
270) The redundancy benefit will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period where
an employee has worked part-time hours during the employee’s period of service and the
employee has less than 24 years full-time service, subject to any minimum amount the
employee is entitled to under the NES.
Earlier periods of service
271) For earlier periods of service to count, there must be no breaks between the periods
of service, except where:
a) the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of
employment with the new employer was made and accepted by the employee
before ceasing employment with the preceding employer, or
b) the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee
was deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under the then section
49 (as repealed in 1966) of the repealed Public Service Act 1922.
Service for severance benefits purposes
272) Having regard to clause 271, and subject to clauses 268 to 270 and clause 275,
service for severance benefit purposes means:
a) service in the department,
b) government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976,
c) service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a Joint
Commonwealth/State body or a body corporate in which the Commonwealth
does not have a controlling interest) which is recognised for long service leave
purposes,
d) service with the Australian Defence Forces,
e) APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under the then section
49 (as repealed in 1966) of the repealed Public Service Act 1922, if the service has
not previously been recognised for redundancy pay purposes, and
f) service in another organisation where an employee was transferred from the APS
to that organisation with a transfer of function or an employee engaged by that
organisation on work within a function is appointed as a result of the transfer of
that function to the APS and such service is recognised for long service leave
purposes.

repealed Public Service Act 1922, or
c) through voluntary retrenchment at or above the minimum retiring age applicable
to the employee, or
d) with the payment of a redundancy benefit or similar payment or an employerfinanced retirement benefit,
will not count as service for severance benefit purposes.
274) Absences from work which do not count as service for any purpose will not count as
service for severance benefit purposes.
Part-time service
275) The severance benefit will be calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period where an
employee has worked part-time hours during the employee’s period of service and the
employee has less than 24 years full-time service.
Severance benefit - rate of payment
276) For the purpose of calculating any payment under this clause, salary will include:
a) the employee's salary, or
b) the salary of the higher position, where the employee has performed duties at
the higher level for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately
preceding the date on which the employee is given notice of retrenchment, and

leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement
for expenses incurred, or a payment for disabilities associated with the
performance of duty.

of leave for personal illness or injury, where supported by satisfactory medical evidence.
Travel expenses incurred
282) The excess employee may request assistance in meeting reasonable travel and
incidental expenses incurred in seeking alternative employment where these expenses are
not met by a prospective employer.
Retirement during retention period
283) Where the Secretary believes there is insufficient productive work available for an
excess employee during the retention period, the Secretary may terminate the employee’s
employment under section 29 of the PS Act, and pay a lump sum comprising:
a) the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the NES) under clauses 277
and 278 and this payment will be taken to include the payment in lieu of notice
