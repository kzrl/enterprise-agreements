C24 Employer superannuation contributions will not be paid during periods of unpaid leave that do not
count as service, unless otherwise required by law.
C25 The Secretary may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying superannuation funds that
allow employee and/or employer contributions to be paid through fortnightly electronic funds
transfer.
JUNIOR RATES OF PAY
C26 Junior rates of pay as a percentage of the APS Level 1 equivalent adult rate will apply as set out in
Appendix 3.
C27 For an employee under 21 years of age employed in a classification of APS Level 1, whose rate of

purposes. Where an employee is absent from the workplace for a period greater than six weeks, the
allowance will not be paid during that period unless otherwise required by law.

the relocation assistance, unless the Secretary agrees to waive this requirement due to extenuating
circumstances.

vaccinations.
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE SCHEME
E3 The Commission will provide access to a confidential, professional counselling service at no cost to
employees and their families to help resolve both personal and work-related problems.

performance feedback process. Progress against individual learning and development agreements
will be included in performance feedback discussions.

Subject to the Secretary’s approval, professional development needs and professional association
membership, where these relate to a qualification required to perform an employee’s duties, may be
funded by the Commission.

STUDIES ASSISTANCE
E6 Assistance may be provided to an employee to undertake formal courses of study at tertiary and
higher education institutions and other vocational education courses, where the study is agreed as

months if this is part of the agreement for the assignment; or

iii)

ongoing and non-ongoing employees who would have completed twelve months of the
feedback cycle had it not been for extenuating circumstances, as approved by the Secretary.

F5

The Commission’s Performance Feedback Scheme policy contains the detailed process for managing
underperformance. The process may be invoked where:

F9

15 of 35

ii)

the performance issues are ongoing; and

iii)

informal resolution has been attempted.

PART G

WORKFORCE ADJUSTMENT

MOVEMENT TO ANOTHER APS AGENCY
G1 An employee, other than an employee engaged for a specified term or for the duration of a specified
task, will, where practicable, give a minimum of four weeks’ notice of their intention to move to
another APS agency, except where a lesser period is agreed with their manager.
SEPARATION FROM THE APS
G2 An employee will, where practicable, give a minimum of four weeks’ notice of their intention to
resign or retire. The relevant delegate may agree to a lesser period of notice.
EXCESS EMPLOYEES
Coverage
G3

The provisions of clauses G4 to G38 will apply to ongoing employees of the Commission who are
not on probation.

Definition of excess employee
G4

An employee is an excess employee if:
i)

the employee is included in a class of employees employed in the Commission which
comprises a greater number of employees than is necessary for the efficient and economical
working of the Commission; or

ii)

the services of the employee cannot be used effectively because of technological or other
changes in the work methods of the Commission or changes in the nature, extent or
organisation of the functions of the Commission.

G5

If an employee is likely to become excess the Secretary will advise them at the earliest practical
time.

G6

Where the potentially excess employee nominates a representative, the Secretary will hold the
discussions with the employee and the employee’s representative.

G7

The Secretary will hold discussions with the employee to advise them of the reasons they may
become excess and to consider:

G8

i)

measures that could be taken to resolve the situation, including redeployment opportunities for
the employee at or below level;

ii)

referral to a service provider approved by the Secretary to provide career planning and other
appropriate assistance; and

iii)

whether voluntary retrenchment might be appropriate.

The Secretary may:
i)

having held the discussions referred to in clause G7; and

ii)

unless the employee consents to a shorter period, not less than four weeks after advising the
employee in accordance with clause G5 that they are likely to become excess, advise the
employee in writing that they are an excess employee.

VOLUNTARY RETRENCHMENT
G9 Where an employee is advised that they are an excess employee in accordance with clause G8, the
Secretary may invite the employee to accept voluntary retrenchment.
16 of 35

G10 Where the Secretary invites an excess employee to accept voluntary retrenchment, the employee will
have four weeks in which to accept the offer.
G11 Where the offer is accepted the Secretary will consider whether to proceed with approval of the
voluntary retrenchment but will not give notice of termination under section 29 of the
Public Service Act on the grounds that the employee is excess to the requirements of the Agency
before the end of that period.
G12 As soon as possible, within the four weeks referred to in clause G8, an excess employee who is
invited to accept voluntary retrenchment must be given information on:
i)

the amount of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice and paid up leave credits;

ii)

the amount of accumulated superannuation contributions;

iii)

options open to the employee concerning superannuation; and

iv)

any taxation rules applying to the various payments.

G13 An excess employee invited to accept voluntary retrenchment will be reimbursed reasonable
expenses for career transition and financial advice.
G14 Only one offer of voluntary retrenchment will be made to an excess employee.
ASSISTANCE
G15 An excess employee will be given assistance in meeting reasonable travel and incidental expenses
incurred in seeking alternative employment (where such expenses are not met by the prospective
employer) and will be given reasonable time off work to attend job interviews.
PERIOD OF NOTICE
G16 Where the excess employee accepts voluntary retrenchment, the Secretary may retrench the
employee by giving the required notice of termination under section 29 of the Public Service Act on
the grounds that the employee is excess to the requirements of the Agency. The period of notice will
be four weeks (or five weeks for an employee 45 years of age and over).
G17 Where an employee's employment is terminated at the beginning of, or within, the notice period, the
employee will receive payment in lieu of notice as set out in the Fair Work Act for the unexpired
portion of the notice period.
SEVERANCE BENEFIT
G18 An employee whose employment is terminated under section 29 of the Public Service Act on the
grounds that the employee is excess to the requirements of the Agency following their agreement to
be voluntarily retrenched is entitled to be paid a severance benefit.
G19 An employee who accepts voluntary retrenchment is entitled to be paid a sum equal to two weeks
salary for each completed year of continuous service plus a pro rata payment for completed months
of service since the last completed year of service subject to any minimum amount the employee is
entitled to under the National Employment Standards (NES).
G20 The minimum sum payable will be four weeks’ salary and the maximum will be 48 weeks’ salary.
G21 The severance benefit will be calculated on a pro rata basis for any period where an employee has
worked part-time hours during their period of service and the employee has less than 24 years
full-time service.
G22 Service for severance pay purposes means:

an employee moved from the APS to that organisation with a transfer of function; or

(2)

an employee engaged by that organisation on work within a function is engaged in the
APS as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS; and

(3)

such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.

G23 For earlier periods of service to count there must be no breaks between the periods of service, except
where:
i)

the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of employment with the
new employer was made and accepted by the employee before ceasing employment with the
preceding employer; or

ii)

the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee was deemed
to have resigned from the APS on marriage under repealed section 49 of the Public Service
Act 1922.

G24 Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes are periods of service
that ceased by way of:
i)

termination under section 29 of the Public Service Act 1999;

ii)

prior to the commencement of the Public Service Act 1999, by way of redundancy; forfeiture
of office, retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or loss of qualifications;
dismissal or termination of probationary appointment for reasons of unsatisfactory service;

iii)

voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the employee; or

iv)

payment of a redundancy benefit or a similar payment or an employer-financed retirement
benefit.

G25 Absences from duty which do not count as service for Long Service Leave purposes will not count
for severance pay purposes.
Rate of Payment
G26 For the purpose of calculating any payment under clause G20, salary will include:

18 of 35

i)

the employee’s salary at their substantive work value level; or

ii)

the salary of the higher work value level, where the employee has been working at the higher
level for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately preceding the date on which
the employee is given notice of retrenchment; and

iii)

other allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of annual leave and on a
regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement for expenses incurred, or a
payment for disabilities associated with the performance of duty.

ACCELERATED SEPARATION OPTION AND ADDITIONAL PAYMENT
G27 Where the Secretary invites an excess employee to accept voluntary retrenchment, the Secretary may
also invite the excess employee to accept an accelerated separation option. This option provides, in
addition to the severance benefit, a payment of a maximum of four weeks’ salary in lieu of the
consideration period referred to in clause G10 where the excess employee agrees to termination of
employment and the employment is so terminated within 14 days of receiving an offer of voluntary
retrenchment. Any payment to which the employee is entitled will be equal to the balance of the four
week period referred to in clause G16.
INVOLUNTARY RETRENCHMENT
G28 The Secretary, under section 29 of the Public Service Act, may terminate the employment of an
excess employee who has not agreed to voluntary retrenchment and has not been permanently
redeployed to an ongoing position.
G29 The Secretary will not terminate the employment of an excess employee if the employee has not
been invited to accept an offer of voluntary retrenchment or has elected to accept an offer of
voluntary retrenchment but the Secretary has refused to approve it. Where an excess employee does
not accept an offer of voluntary retrenchment or the accelerated separation option within four weeks
of the offer being made, the arrangements in clauses G30 to G38 will apply.
G30 An excess employee will be entitled to a period of retention, as detailed in clause G34, in which they
will have access to the services of a provider approved by the Secretary to the value of $2 600 in
order to assist them to be redeployed.
G31 The employee is also entitled to funding for financial advice to the value of $900 less any amount
already paid in accordance with clause G13. Any entitlement to this funding ceases on completion of
the retention period or on termination of employment as detailed in Clause G37.
G32 During the period of retention the Secretary will take all reasonable steps, consistent with the
interests of the efficient administration of the Commission, to assign new duties to an excess
employee at their substantive classification level within the Commission.
G33 The Secretary, after taking reasonable steps to find alternative employment in the Commission at the
excess employee’s substantive classification, may, with four weeks’ notice, allocate a lower
classification to the employee, having determined that duties appropriate to that classification are to
be performed by the employee. The employee will receive income maintenance to maintain their
salary at the previous higher level for the balance of the retention period.
RETENTION PERIOD
G34 Employees declared potentially excess will be entitled to the following retention periods:
i)

13 months where an employee has 20 or more years of service or is over 45 years of age; or

ii)

7 months for other employees.

G35 The retention period will commence on the day the employee is advised in writing by the Secretary,
in accordance with clause G8, that they are an excess employee. Where insufficient productive work
is available for the employee they will not be expected to attend work premises.
G36 The retention period will be extended by any periods of personal leave certified as sick leave taken
during the retention period.
19 of 35

G37 Where the Secretary is satisfied that there is insufficient productive work available for the employee
within the Commission during the remainder of their retention period or where the employee
requests, the Secretary may, after consulting with the employee or the employee’s nominated
representative, terminate the employment of the employee under section 29 of the Public Service Act
and pay the employee’s NES redundancy entitlement and the balance of the retention period
(reduced by the NES entitlement) as a lump sum. This payment will be taken to include the payment
in lieu of notice of termination.
G38 Where an employee enters into a retention period, the Secretary will reduce the retention period by
the employee’s NES redundancy entitlement. Upon termination of employment the employee’s NES
redundancy entitlement will be paid as a lump sum payment.
TERMINATION OF NON-ONGOING EMPLOYEES
G39 Without limiting the authority of the Secretary under s.29(1) of the Public Service Act, the Secretary
may terminate a non-ongoing employee’s employment where he or she is engaged for a specific term
and:
i)

the duties for which he or she was engaged are no longer available;

ii)

the required tasks have been completed ahead of time; or

iii)

the duties are no longer required to be performed.

G40 The Secretary will give a minimum of four weeks’ written notice of an intended termination under
Clause G39.
G41 A non-ongoing employee whose employment is terminated under clause G39 will be entitled to
compensation in respect of the period of service forgone, recognising the particular circumstances of
the engagement.

PROCEDURES FOR PREVENTING AND SETTLING DISPUTES OVER THIS AGREEMENT
AND RESOLVING WORKPLACE ISSUES
H19 This term sets out procedures to settle the dispute where a dispute relates to:
i)

a matter arising under the agreement; or

ii)

the National Employment Standards.

H20 An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the purposes of the
procedures in this term.
H21 In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the workplace level,
by discussions between the employee or employees and relevant supervisors and/or management.
H22 If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may refer the
matter to Fair Work Commission.
H23 The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in two stages:
i)

the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate,
including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a recommendation; and

ii)

if the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the
Fair Work Commission may then:
(1)

arbitrate the dispute; and

(2)

make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Note: If Fair Work Australia arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available to it
under the Act. A decision that Fair Work Australia makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision
for the purpose of Div 3 of Part 5.1 of the Fair Work Act 2009. Therefore, an appeal may be made
against the decision.
H24 While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in Clauses H22 to H23:
i)

an employee must continue to perform his or her work as he or she would normally unless he
or she has a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety; and

ii)

an employee must comply with a direction given by the Secretary to perform other available
work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
(1)

the work is not safe;

(2)

applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the work to be
performed;

(3)

the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or

(4)

there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply with the
direction.

H25 The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair Work Commission in
accordance with this term.

I37

26 of 35

Where an employee dies, or the Secretary has directed that an employee will be presumed to have
died on a particular date, the Secretary may authorise the payment of the amount to which the former

APPENDIX 4 SUPPORTED SALARY RATES
J1

This Appendix defines the conditions that will apply to employees who, because of the
effects of a disability, are eligible for a supported wage. In the context of this Appendix, the
following definitions will apply:

J2

‘Supported Wage System’ (SWS) means the Commonwealth Government system to promote
employment for people who cannot work at full salary because of a disability, as documented
in the Supported Wage System Handbook published by the Department of Employment.

J3

‘Accredited Assessor’ means a person accredited by the Supported Wage Management Unit
of the Department of Employment to perform assessments of an individual's productive
capacity within the SWS.

J4

‘Disability Support Pension’ means the Commonwealth pension scheme to provide income
security for persons with a disability as provided for under the Social Security Act 1991, as
amended from time to time, or any successor to that scheme.

J5

‘Assessment Instrument’ means the form provided for under the SWS that records the
assessment of the productive capacity of the person to be employed under the SWS.

Eligibility Criteria
J6
Employees covered by this Appendix will be those who are unable to perform the range of
duties to the competence level required within the class of work for which the employee is
engaged, because of the effects of a disability on their productive capacity, and who meet the
impairment criteria test for a Disability Support Pension.
J7

This Appendix does not apply to any existing employee who has a claim against the
employer which is subject to the provisions of workers' compensation legislation or any
provision of this Agreement relating to the rehabilitation of employees who are injured in the
course of their employment.

J8

Employees who are eligible for a supported salary in accordance with the SWS will be paid
the applicable percentage of the relevant salary rate prescribed below for the work value they
are performing as follows, provided the amount payable will be not less than $81 per week.

For the purpose of establishing the percentage of the relevant salary rate to be paid to an
employee under this Agreement, the productive capacity of the employee will be assessed in
accordance with the SWS and documented in an assessment instrument.

Lodgement of Assessment Instrument
J10 All assessment instruments under the conditions of this Appendix, including the appropriate
percentage of the relevant salary rate to be paid to the employee, shall be lodged by the
employer with the Registrar of the Fair Work Commission.
J11

All assessment instruments shall be agreed to and signed by the parties to the assessment.

Review of Assessment
J12 The assessment of the applicable percentage should be subject to annual review or earlier on
the basis of a reasonable request for such a review. The process of review shall be in
accordance with the procedures for assessing capacity under the SWS.
Other Terms and Conditions of Employment
J13 Where an assessment has been made, the applicable percentage shall apply to the salary rate
only. Employees covered by the provisions of this Appendix will be entitled to the same
terms and conditions of employment as all other employees covered by this Agreement, paid
on a pro rata basis.
Workplace Adjustment
J14 The CGC shall take all reasonable steps to make changes in the workplace to enhance the
employee's capacity to do the job. Changes may involve redesign of job duties, working time
arrangements and work organisation in consultation with other employees in the area.
Trial Period
J15 In order for an adequate assessment of the employee's capacity to be made, an employer may
employ a person under the provisions of this Appendix for a trial period not exceeding
12 weeks, except that in some cases additional work adjustment time (not exceeding four
weeks) may be needed.
J16

During that trial period the assessment of capacity shall be undertaken and the proposed
salary rate for a continuing employment relationship shall be determined.

J17

The minimum amount payable to the employee during the trial period shall not be less than
that determined by the Fair Work Commission or its successor.

J18

Where the employer and employee wish to establish a continuing employment relationship
following the completion of the trial period, a further contract of employment shall be
entered into based on the outcome of assessment mentioned above.
