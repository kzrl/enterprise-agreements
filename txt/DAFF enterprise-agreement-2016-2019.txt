Service (SES) employees in the Department employed under the Public Service Act 1999 (PS Act).

1.4

Employees performing duties temporarily at the SES level will continue to be subject to this
Agreement but may have additional entitlements in accordance with the flexible remuneration
provisions, and/or a common law agreement, or a determination made by the Secretary, as normally
applied to departmental SES employees.

This Agreement will commence operation seven days after approval by the Fair Work Commission
and will nominally expire three years after its commencement.

PART 2 – CONSULTATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
PRINCIPLE
2.1

The Department is committed to communicating and consulting with employees and where advised,
employee representatives, about the implementation and operation of this Agreement. The role of any
nominated employee representatives will be respected and facilitated.

2.2

The Department recognises that an employee may, in matters concerning their employment, choose
to have a representative of their choice to support or represent them. A representative requested by

with each other in good faith.

DEPARTMENTAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE
2.3

The Departmental Consultative Committee (DCC) is the peak forum for consultation with employees.
Its membership will have at least as many employee representatives (nominated or elected by employees) as management representatives. The DCC will meet at least four times a year to discuss and
consult on proposed changes within the Department, including human resource policy, and the implementation of government decisions as they apply to the Department.

2.4

The DCC will be able to establish regional, geographical or other sub-committees as required.

2.5

Terms of reference will be maintained by the DCC.

CONSULTATION ON POLICIES SUPPORTING THIS AGREEMENT
2.6

Policies will support the operation of this Agreement, and may identify other entitlements contained in
relevant legislation. Prior to a policy that supports the operations of this Agreement being amended or
introduced the Department will make the policy available on the intranet for comment and feedback for
a period of at least two weeks. The Department will consider any comments or feedback received in
relation to the policy prior to finalising it. Where the introduction or amendment of such a policy involves a major change or a change to a regular roster or ordinary hours of work clauses 2.7 to 2.23
will apply.

CONSULTATION ON MAJOR CHANGE AND CHANGES TO ROSTERS AND ORDINARY HOURS
OF WORK
2.7

3

2.12 As soon as practicable after making its decision, the Department must
a. discuss with the relevant employees
i. the introduction of the change and
ii. the effect the change is likely to have on the employees and
iii. measures the employer is taking to avert or mitigate the adverse effect of the change on the
employees and
b. for the purposes of the discussion provide, in writing, to the relevant employees
i. all relevant information about the change, including the nature of the change proposed and

2.13 However, the Department is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information
to the relevant employees.
2.14 The Department must give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised about the major
change by the relevant employees.
2.15 If a term in this Agreement provides for a major change to operations, program, organisation, structure
or technology in relation to the enterprise of the Department, the requirements set out in clauses 2.9,
2.10 and 2.12 are taken not to apply.
2.16 Regarding clause 2.7, a major change is likely to have a significant effect on employees if it results in:
a. the termination of the employment of employees or
b. major change to the composition, operation or size of the employer’s workforce or to the skills
required of employees or
c. the elimination or diminution of job opportunities (including opportunities for promotion or tenure) or
d. the alteration of hours of work or
e. the need to retrain employees or
f. the need to relocate employees to another workplace or
g. the restructuring of jobs.
Change to Regular Roster or Ordinary Hours of Work

proposed change.
2.19 If a relevant employee(s) appoints a representative for the purposes of consultation and advises the
Department of the identity of the representative, the Department will recognise the representative.
2.20 As soon as practicable after proposing to introduce the change, the Department will:
a. discuss the introduction of the change with relevant employees and
b. for the purposes of those discussions, provide to the relevant employee
i.

all relevant information about the change, including the nature of the change proposed

ii.

information about what the Department reasonably believes will be the effect on the employee

iii.

information about any other matter that the Department reasonably believes is likely to affect
the employees and

impact in relation to their family or caring responsibilities).
2.21 The Department is not required to disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information to the
relevant employees.
2.22 The Department will give prompt and genuine consideration to matters raised by the relevant
employees about the change.
4

2.23 In clauses 2.9 to 2.22, ‘relevant employees’ means the employees who may be affected by a major
change or a proposed change to a regular roster or ordinary hours of work.

RESOLUTION OF AGREEMENT DISPUTES
2.24 If a dispute relates to a matter under this Agreement, or under the National Employment Standards
(NES), the following clauses (2.25 to 2.31) set out the procedures to settle the dispute.
2.25 An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the purposes of the
procedures in this term.
2.26 In the first instance, parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the workplace level by
discussions between the employee(s) and the relevant management.
2.27 If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may refer the
matter to the Fair Work Commission.
2.28 The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in two stages:
a. the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate,
including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a recommendation and
b. if the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the Fair Work
Commission may then
i. arbitrate the dispute and
ii. make a determination that is binding on the parties.
2.29 Note: If the Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available
to it under the FW Act. A decision that the Fair Work Commission makes when arbitrating a dispute is
a decision for the purpose of Part 5.1, Division 3 of the FW Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made
against the decision.
2.30 While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this term:
a. an employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally, unless they have a
reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety and
b. an employee must comply with a direction given by the Delegate to perform other available work at
the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless
i. the work is not safe or
ii. applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the work to be performed
or
iii. the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform or
iv. there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply with the direction.
2.31 The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair Work Commission in
accordance with this term.
REVIEW OF DECISIONS/ACTIONS
2.32 An employee is entitled to request an internal review of certain decisions/actions that relate to their
employment under section 33 of the PS Act 1999 and part 5 of the Public Service Regulations 1999.
Further information is contained in the Department’s Review of Actions Policy.

PART 3 – WORKING ARRANGEMENTS
PRINCIPLE
3.1

The Department will provide a flexible approach to working arrangements that assists and equitably
supports all employees (regardless of gender) and the organisation to balance work and personal priorities. A sufficient number of employees meeting both safety and operational requirements, as determined by the relevant Branch Head and/or as required by any relevant legislation, should be at work
to meet client needs during normal business hours.

HOURS OF DUTY
Ordinary Hours of Work
3.2

The ordinary hours of work for full-time employees (other than shiftworkers) are 37 hours and 30
minutes per week, to be worked on the basis of seven hours and 30 minutes each day, Monday to
Friday. Ordinary hours of work for shiftworkers are an average total of 150 hours per four-week period.

3.3

The standard working day is considered to be 8.30 am to 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm to 5.00 pm (seven
hours and 30 minutes per day) Monday to Friday.

3.4

For part-time employees, ordinary hours of work are the hours of work agreed in their part-time work
agreement.

Bandwidth
3.5

The bandwidth during which employees may work their ordinary hours will be 12 hours in length,
Monday to Friday, usually 7.00 am to 7.00 pm.

3.6

For operational requirements, the Delegate may vary the starting and finishing times for the 12-hour
bandwidth for a workplace, after consultation with the affected employees in accordance with clause
2.17 to 2.23 of this Agreement.

Recording Working Hours
3.7

Employees are required to record the times they commence and finish work (including breaks) each
day.

3.8

Over a four-week settlement period the standard total working hours for full-time employees is 150.

3.9

Part-time employees are required to record their hours based on their agreed part-time working
arrangement.

Advising Absence
3.10 Where an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend work they must ensure their Manager is advised
before they would normally commence, unless it is not reasonable to do so.
Meal Breaks
3.11 When an employee has worked for five hours continuously they must take a break of at least
30 minutes, except when their hours to be worked on that day are no more than six hours and the
employee has requested to work beyond the five-hour period.
Lactation Breaks
3.12 Nursing mothers are entitled to take lactation breaks as and when needed. It is expected that
employees will discuss these arrangements with their Manager. Suitable facilities will be provided
where possible.

6

FLEXIBLE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS
3.13 The Department recognises that employees have personal and family commitments and is committed
to providing employees with reasonable flexibility in working arrangements and to be responsive and
assist employees to balance their personal and work commitments.
3.14 Employees can request flexible working arrangements that change the hours, pattern or location of
their work. When assessing requests for flexible working arrangements, the Delegate will respond in
writing within three weeks (providing reasons if request is declined) and will consider:
a.
b.
c.

operational requirements
impact on the team and
any personal circumstances behind the request.

3.15 The Delegate may decline a request for flexible working arrangements only on reasonable business
grounds. Further information on flexible working arrangements is contained in the Department’s Working Arrangements Policy.
3.16 An employee also has the right to request a flexible working arrangement in accordance with the provisions of the NES set out in section 65 of the FW Act.
Flextime
3.17 Flextime applies to employees in classifications at the APS 1 to APS 6 levels (except those who work
on a shift roster or fixed daily hours basis) and enables employees to build up and make use of
working time credits. Further information on flextime and flex leave is contained in the Department’s
Working Arrangements Policy.
3.18 A maximum of 37 hours and 30 minutes in flex credits or a maximum of 20 hours in flex debits may be
carried over from one settlement period to the next. The Delegate may agree to a higher carryover of
credit or debit in exceptional circumstances. Managers and employees will take joint responsibility to
maintain flex credits and debits within these limits. Managers will facilitate opportunities for employees
to access flex leave to avoid the accumulation of excessive flex credits. Where an employee exceeds
the maximum flex debit at the end of the settlement period, the excess debit may be treated as an
overpayment of salary and the Department may take steps to recover the overpayment in accordance
with clause 4.46.
3.19 In exceptional circumstances the Delegate may determine payment in lieu of flex credits.
3.20 In exceptional circumstances the Department may require employees to work extended hours within
the bandwidth (i.e. flextime) to meet high-priority operational requirements.
3.21 Where APS 1 to 6 level employees are required by Managers to work outside the applicable
bandwidth (usually 7.00 am to 7.00 pm), overtime is payable.
3.22 Where an employee ceases employment with the Department and their Manager certifies that they
were unable to utilise their flex credits due to operational requirements, the Delegate will authorise a
payment in lieu of the flex credits at single-time rates up to a maximum of 37 hours and 30 minutes.
3.23 Employees at APS 1 to 6 levels required to travel within Australia on departmental business may include the travel time as ordinary working hours on their standard departmental attendance record.
Employees at other levels are expected to travel for reasonable periods of time outside normal business hours where this is necessary to perform their work.
Removal of Flextime
3.24 A Manager may remove an employee’s access to flextime arrangements (so that their working hours
are in accordance with clause 3.3) where the Manager, after discussion with the employee, reasonably considers the employee’s attendance is unsatisfactory or that the employee is misusing the flex7

time arrangements. The Manager will provide a written explanation of the reasons for their decision.
Where such an employee is required to work hours additional to their standard working day they will
be paid overtime in accordance with table 3.54.1. Access to flextime arrangements may be restored
when the Manager is satisfied the employee’s attendance is satisfactory and misuse of flextime arrangements is unlikely to reoccur.
Working Arrangements for Executive Level Employees
3.25 While the flextime provisions as outlined in clauses 3.17 to 3.24 do not apply to Executive Level (EL)
employees, Managers have an obligation to allow these employees flexibility in their working
arrangements, including hours of work, and have the authority to grant time off in recognition of
additional hours worked where such hours are in excess of agreed working arrangements. However,
time off will not be granted on an exact time for time basis. The working arrangements for an EL
employee should be agreed at the section or branch level through discussion between the Manager
and the EL employee. Further information is contained in the Department’s Working Arrangements
Policy.
3.26 EL employees are not eligible to work shiftwork (clauses 3.59 to 3.68) although they are eligible to
work part-time (clauses 3.27 to 3.34).
Part-Time Work
3.27 A part-time employee is one whose ordinary hours of work are less than 75 hours over a two-week
settlement period commencing on a Thursday payday and finishing on a Wednesday. Salaries and
some allowances (see clause 5.1 and Schedule 2) for part-time employees will be paid at a pro rata
rate based on their agreed ordinary hours of work. Leave entitlements for part-time employees will
also accrue at a pro rata rate based on their agreed ordinary hours of work .
3.28 Employees who commenced employment with the Department on a part-time basis will not be required to convert from part-time to full-time hours without their agreement.
3.29 Employees will not be required to convert from full-time to part-time hours without their agreement.
3.30 An employee may request in writing to work on a part-time basis for up to 12 months at a time. The
Delegate will respond in writing within three weeks providing reasons if the request is declined. The
Delegate may decline a request for part-time work only on reasonable business grounds and will consider:
a.
b.
c.

operational requirements
impact on the team and
any personal circumstances behind the request.

3.31 Any employee returning from parental or maternity leave will have the right to work part-time hours
during the period within two years of the birth (or, in the case of adoption or Permanent Care, within
two years of the placement) of the child. Beyond this period, approval will be given in accordance with
the part-time provisions of this Agreement unless part-time work does not meet operational
requirements.
3.32 Part-time work arrangements must be set out in a written part-time work agreement between the
employee and their Manager specifying the days and hours to be worked during a settlement period.
These arrangements should be reviewed on an annual basis, at a minimum. The part-time work
agreement must ensure that any single period of attendance is no less than three hours and 45
minutes in any one day and no less than seven hours and 30 minutes in any one week.
3.33 At the expiry of a part-time work agreement the Delegate will consider any request from the employee
for a new part-time work agreement in accordance with clauses 3.30 and 3.32 and subject to 3.28.

8

3.34 A part-time employee may convert to full-time hours before the expiry of their part-time work
agreement only with the Delegate’s approval. Part-time employees will not be required to extend or
change their part-time work arrangements or to convert to full-time hours before the expiry of their
part-time work agreement without their agreement.
Job Sharing
3.35 The Department encourages and will facilitate the use of job-sharing arrangements where feasible.
Part-time work can be used for job-sharing arrangements where both employees are at the same
classification level. All parties to the arrangement must complete a written agreement setting out the
conditions of the arrangement.

PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
3.36 Employees will be entitled to the following public holidays:










New Year’s Day (1 January)
Australia Day (26 January)
Good Friday
Easter Monday
Anzac Day (25 April)
the Queen’s Birthday holiday (on the day on which it is celebrated in the relevant State or
Territory or relevant region of a State or Territory)
Christmas Day (25 December)
Boxing Day (26 December)
any other day or part-day declared or prescribed by or under a law of the relevant State or
Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or relevant region of the State or
Territory, as a public holiday, other than a day or part-day, or a kind of day or part-day, that is
excluded by the Fair Work regulations from counting as a public holiday.

3.37 If under a State or Territory law a day or part-day is substituted for one of the public holidays listed
above, then the substituted day or part-day is the public holiday.
3.38 The Delegate and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day or part-day that would
otherwise be a public holiday, having regard to operational requirements. Where an employee cannot
work on a day for which a substituted holiday has been granted, the affected employee will work
make-up time at times to be agreed, without entitlement to overtime payment.
3.39 An employee, other than a shiftworker, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in
the place where the employee is based for work purposes is entitled to be paid for the part- or full-day
absence as if that day or part-day was not a public holiday, except where that employee would not
normally have worked on that day.
3.40 An employee who is on unpaid leave that includes both the working day before and the working day
after a public holiday (or consecutive public holidays) will not receive payment for this (these) public
holiday(s). The holidays occurring between Christmas and New Year each year will be regarded as
consecutive.
3.41 Employees who receive a loading in lieu of leave entitlements (clause 4.5 of this Agreement) will not
receive payment for a public holiday unless they work on the public holiday.
3.42 Payment of temporary reassignment of duties allowance at a higher level for a public holiday is only
payable where the employee is in receipt of that allowance on both the working day before and the
working day after the public holiday.

9

CHRISTMAS CLOSEDOWN
3.43 The Department will close its normal operations from close of business on the last working day before
Christmas and resume normal operations on the first working day after New Year’s Day.
3.44 Employees will be provided with time off for the weekdays between Christmas and New Year’s Day
and will be paid in accordance with their ordinary hours of work. Where an employee is absent on
leave, payment for the Christmas closedown provision will be in accordance with the entitlement for
that form of leave (e.g. if they are on long service leave at half pay, payment is at half pay).
3.45 There will be no deduction from annual or personal/carer’s leave credits for the closedown days.
3.46 Duty performed on the weekday immediately following the Boxing Day public holiday or its substitute
will be paid as public holiday duty.
3.47 In cases where employees are required by their Manager to work on the second or third weekday
following the Boxing Day public holiday or its substitute, they must be provided with two days of time
off in lieu to be taken within four weeks of New Year’s Day or an alternative time agreed between the
employee and their Manager.

OVERTIME DUTY
3.48 Employees working at the APS 1 to APS 6 classification level who are required by their Manager to
work outside the bandwidth, or on weekends or public holidays, will be paid at overtime rates (subject
to clause 3.53). However, travel time will not be paid as overtime. The entitlement to overtime meal
allowance is contained in clause 5.2.
3.49 Overtime on a normal working day will normally only be allowed outside the bandwidth (except for
employees who work on a shift roster or fixed daily hours basis) where an employee is required by
their Manager to continue work after they have completed nine hours of work on that same day
(excluding meal breaks). In exceptional circumstances (for example in priority or emergency
situations) where the Manager assesses that overtime is appropriate, overtime may be approved by
the Delegate within the flextime bandwidth for the period worked beyond seven hours and 30 minutes.
3.50 Where a part-time employee at the APS 1 to APS 6 classification level is required by their Manager to
work extra duty outside their ordinary working hours the overtime rate of payment will apply.
3.51 Where an employee who has a flex debit is required to work overtime, they may eliminate their flex
debit (at the overtime rate) before overtime is payable.
Rest Break
3.52 Employees are required to have a rest break of at least ten hours, including reasonable travelling time,
between ceasing duty on any day (or shift) and commencing work on the next day (or shift). Where
such a break is not possible, the employee will be paid double the regular rate of pay until they have
such a break.
Option to Take Time Off in Lieu
3.53 Where an employee would prefer to take time off in lieu or accrue flex credit rather than receive
payment for overtime duty, and their Manager agrees to that arrangement, they are entitled to take
that time in either circumstance at the same rate at which they would have received it as an overtime
payment.
Overtime – Rate of Payment
3.54 Overtime duty is payable at the following rates as outlined in Table 3.54.1.

10

TABLE 3.54.1
Overtime Period

Rate

Monday to Friday
(outside bandwidth
hours)

1½ hours for each hour (or part thereof, rounded to the
nearest 15 minutes) worked for the first 3 hours, and
2 hours for each hour worked thereafter

Saturday

1½ hours for each hour worked for the first 3 hours, and
2 hours for each hour worked thereafter

Sunday

2 hours for each hour worked

Public holidays (within
ordinary hours)

1½ hours for each hour worked (as employees are already
receiving payment for the public holiday at single-time rates)

Public Holidays (outside
ordinary hours)

2½ hours for each hour worked

Minimum Period for Overtime Payment on Weekends and Public Holidays
3.55 Subject to clauses 5.3 to 5.9 (Restriction Allowance), where an employee is required to work overtime
on a weekend or public holiday, they will be paid for a minimum period of two hours at the appropriate
overtime rate.
Emergency Duty
3.56 This clause only applies to employees in classifications at the APS 1 to APS 6 level. Where an
employee is called on duty to respond to an emergency at a time when they would not normally have
been on duty, and has been given no notice of such a call prior to ceasing ordinary duty, they will be
paid for the emergency duty at double their regular rate of pay. The period for which this emergency
payment will be made will include time necessarily spent travelling to and from duty. The minimum
payment under this clause will be two hours at double the regular rate of pay.
Overtime for Executive Level Employees
3.57 The Delegate may approve payment of overtime, on a case-by-case basis, to EL employees assigned
to information technology duties who perform extra duties on a regular and continuing basis to provide
non-discretionary computing services that cannot be undertaken during ordinary hours.
3.58 Apart from the circumstances in clause 3.57, EL employees are only eligible to receive overtime
payments in exceptional circumstances. In assessing exceptional circumstances the Delegate will take
into account:
a. the nature and extent of the overtime
b. whether the overtime has been directed and certified (such as on restriction)
c. whether the nature of directions received means that the overtime must be done (i.e. it is
unavoidable and can only be performed by employees at that level)
d. whether the extra duty is regular and excessive, compared with that worked by employees
generally at the same level, over a long period of time (i.e. on a continuing basis, as overtime
is not usually paid for one-off special tasks)
e. whether the extra duty is burdensome or unusually urgent compared with that undertaken by
employees at the same level.

SHIFTWORK AND FIXED DAILY HOURS
3.59 A shiftworker is an employee at APS 1 to APS 6 level who is rostered to perform ordinary duty outside
the period of 6.30 am to 6.00 pm on Monday to Friday and/or is rostered to work on Saturdays,
11

Sundays or public holidays for an ongoing or fixed period. Employees employed on a fixed daily hours
or shift roster basis are not entitled to flextime as outlined in clauses 3.17 to 3.23. This definition does
not prevent a shiftworker returning from parental or maternity leave requesting to work on a part-time
basis under clause 3.30.
3.60 Where for operational reasons the Delegate considers that employees in a work area should work
fixed daily hours or shiftwork, the Delegate may require an employee to work these hours. The actual
hours of work and rostering arrangements will be determined at the work place (including any
arrangements for working additional hours towards an accrued day off) by the local Manager after
consultation with affected employees.
3.61 Except at the regular changeover of shifts an employee should not be required to work more than one
shift in each 24 hours.
3.62 The department may change fixed daily hours or shiftwork rosters by mutual consent of the Manager
and affected employees at any time or by amendment of the roster on ten working days notice given
by the Manager to the affected employees. In the absence of consent or ten working days notice, employees will be paid overtime for work outside the previously rostered hours of duty. Payments on this
basis will be continued for each changed shift until employees have received ten working days notice
of the shift changing. However this payment does not apply where a Manager is unable to give ten
working days notice because of the sickness or unanticipated absence of another employee.
3.63 Employees working fixed daily hours or on a shift roster basis may exchange shifts or rostered days
off with another employee by mutual agreement, and the consent of the Manager. Shifts and rostered
days off must not be exchanged if the arrangement would entitle either employee to an overtime payment.
3.64 Where a public holiday occurs on a shiftworker’s rostered day off the employee will be granted one
day of leave in lieu of that public holiday within a month or if this is not practicable, they will be paid
one days pay at ordinary rates.
3.65 The Manager may remove an employee or group of employees from a shiftwork roster to work
ordinary hours after consulting with affected employees in accordance with clauses 2.17 to 2.23 and
providing 28 days notice. For employees who have been on a fixed roster (shiftwork or fixed daily
hours) for four years or more, salary maintenance for a three month period (including the 28 day
notice period) will be provided.
3.66 Where employees employed on a fixed daily hours or a shift roster basis are required to work
additional hours, they will receive overtime payments for all duty performed outside their rostered or
fixed hours. An employee may elect to take time off at overtime rates in lieu of overtime payments,
subject to operational requirements and approval of the Delegate. Where an employee ceases
employment with the Department and their Manager certifies that they were unable to access their
time in lieu credits prior to ceasing, they will receive payment for those credits.
3.67 Shift penalty payments will not be taken into account in the calculation of overtime or in the calculation
of any allowance based on salary.
3.68 Shiftworkers who do not receive commuted penalty payments (clause 3.69) will be paid the penalty
rates outlined in Table 3.68.1.

Further information is contained in the Department’s Shiftwork, Fixed Daily Hours and Commuted Penalties
Policy.

COMMUTED PENALTY PAYMENTS
3.69 Commuted penalty payments are the preferred means of compensating employees who work a shift
roster on a long term basis. Where the Delegate determines that a shiftworker will be paid a
commuted penalty, the shiftworker will be paid a consistent additional percentage of their base salary
each fortnightly pay period in lieu of being required to make separate claims on each occasion a
penalty rate may otherwise be applicable. A commuted penalty payment will be determined by
applying the penalty rates outlined in table 3.68.1 to a relevant shift roster pattern over a full year.
Further information is provided in the Department’s Shiftwork, Fixed Daily Hours and Commuted
Penalties Policy.
3.70 The commuted penalty will continue to be paid during periods of personal/carers’ leave, annual leave
and other paid leave (but not for periods of long service leave in any circumstances).

TEMPORARY REASSIGNMENT TO SHIFTWORK
3.71 Where an employee is temporarily reassigned to duties involving a shiftwork roster they will receive
either the relevant commuted penalty payment or if the temporary reassignment is for a short period
only they will apply for and be paid shift penalties in accordance with the shift work and fixed daily
hours clauses 3.59 to 3.68. If this shiftwork roster involves the employee working weekends as a part
of the roster (as for example in a ten days on, four days off roster) they will receive a day off for each
Saturday and Sunday worked as part of their rostered days off.

13

PART 4 – REMUNERATION

public holidays on which the employee is not rostered to work and all paid leave entitlements except
long service leave, which is covered by the provisions of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth
Employees) Act 1976. The loading is calculated in accordance with the employee’s base annual salary
rate. The employee will be paid for the time worked, rounded up to the nearest 15 minutes. The
minimum payment per attendance will be two hours.

4.35 Where an employee commences employment in the Department or is promoted within the
Department, the employee’s salary will be at the base point in the salary range applicable to the
classification of the job.
4.36 The Delegate may, however, determine the employee’s salary above the base point in the salary
range applicable to the classification of the job, having regard to the experience, qualifications and
skills of the employee.

SALARY MAINTENANCE
4.37 Where an ongoing employee moves to the Department from another APS agency and their salary in
that agency exceeds the current maximum salary of the relevant classification in this Agreement, the
Delegate may agree to maintain the employee’s current salary until such time as that salary is
absorbed by future remuneration increases.
4.38 Where an ongoing employee moves to the Department at the same level directly from another APS
agency, the employee’s new salary will be set at the salary in this Agreement in the same
classification which is closest to but above the salary paid in the former APS agency.
4.39 Where an employee’s salary is set at an incorrect pay point within the applicable classification level
(e.g. because of an administrative error), the Delegate may determine in writing that the employee’s
salary be determined in accordance with a different pay point.

SALARY ON REDUCTION
4.40 Where an employee permanently moves to a lower classification (for reasons other than misconduct
or under-performance), their salary will be payable at the highest pay point in the salary range of the
lower classification.

SALARY PROGRESSION
4.49 Employees (except Expeditioner employees or those in the Training Broadband) will receive an annual
increase in their salary (substantive and/or acting) to the next higher pay point in their classification
level as set out in Schedule 1 of this Agreement, if on September 1 each year:
a. their performance is assessed at their annual performance review as at least fully effective
(further information is contained in the Department’s PDS Policy)
b. they are not already receiving salary at the highest pay point of their substantive and, if

indicates satisfactory performance.

EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS
4.52 The Department will make compulsory employer contributions as required by the applicable legislation
and fund requirements.
4.53 Where employer contributions are to an accumulation superannuation fund the employer contribution
will be 15.4 per cent of fortnightly salary. This will not be reduced by any other contributions made
through salary sacrifice arrangements. This clause does not apply where a superannuation fund
cannot accept employer superannuation contributions (e.g. the fund is unable to accept contributions
for people aged over 75).
4.54 The Department will make superannuation contributions for employees who earn below the
Superannuation Guarantee minimum payment of $450 per month.
4.55 For employees who take half pay or unpaid parental leave (which includes maternity, adoption,

superannuation scheme.
4.56 Except for employees who take unpaid parental leave (see clause 4.55) employer superannuation
contributions will not be paid during periods of unpaid leave that do not count as service, unless
otherwise required by law.
4.57 The Delegate may choose to limit superannuation choice to complying superannuation funds that
allow employee and/or employer contributions to be paid through fortnightly electronic funds transfer.

5.1

All allowance amounts are listed in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. Where indicated in Schedule 2,
part-time employees are only entitled to a pro rata amount of these allowances based on their parttime hours; otherwise they are entitled to the full allowance.

OVERTIME MEAL ALLOWANCE
5.2

An employee is entitled to a meal allowance if the employee works more than two hours overtime duty

additional meal allowance. Overtime entitlements are contained in clauses 3.48 to 3.58.

RESTRICTION ALLOWANCES
5.3

An employee (excluding AAD employees for whom clauses 5.10 to 5.12 apply) may be required to be
‘on restriction’, which means they are contactable and available to perform extra duty outside their
normal hours of work. In addition, employees may have some restrictions placed on their mobility,
such as distance from work, and must be ready to work. Normal hours of work means for:
a. a shiftworker, the employee’s rostered hours of duty
b. an employee with fixed daily hours, those hours, excluding public holidays and the
Christmas closedown
c.

An employee will be paid a restriction allowance for each hour they are required to be on restriction at
the rate of 8.5 per cent of their hourly salary.

5.5

Salary for the purpose of calculation of restriction allowance will include additional remuneration paid
for temporary re-assignment at a higher level and any allowances in the nature of salary.

5.6

An employee, other than an EL employee, who is required to perform work or duties while restricted,
will be paid overtime for the hours actually worked. Payment of overtime for any one day will be:
a. if the employee is not required to be recalled to the place of work, payment in accordance
with overtime provisions, the minimum payment being for one hour or
b. if the employee is recalled to the place of work, payment in accordance with overtime
provisions, the minimum payment being for three hours.

5.7

Where an employee is on restriction and required to monitor and respond regularly to the radio, they
will be paid overtime for the first two hours of the restriction period.

5.8

The Delegate may determine an alternative amount of the restriction allowance rate, which may
include the payment of overtime having regard to the circumstances of the restriction situation.

5.9

Where more than one attendance or call is involved, the minimum payment provisions will not apply.
An employee’s overtime payment will not be greater than the amount that would have been payable
had the employee remained on duty from the commencing time of duty on one attendance to the
ceasing time of duty on a subsequent attendance.

AAD RESTRICTION ALLOWANCE
5.10 Where the relevant Manager (Delegate) determines that there is a requirement for an employee to be
contactable and available to work extra duty on a regular, extensive and continuing basis, that
employee will be paid a restriction allowance at a rate in accordance with Schedule 2 of this
Agreement. This allowance covers telephone calls necessary to provide advice and/or to resolve
22

problems, and attendance to the employee’s place of work or another location to perform duties of up
to three hours where necessary. No other allowance is payable to employees if they receive a
restriction allowance under this clause. If an employee in receipt of a restriction allowance is required
to attend work, overtime is payable for the portion of attendances extending beyond three hours. This
allowance does not count as salary for superannuation purposes.
5.11 Where the employee is unavailable for restriction for more than a day the restriction allowance will
cease for the period when they are unavailable.
5.12 In exceptional cases where the employee on restriction is unavailable another employee may be
called as back-up and the Manager may approve payment to the back-up employee at the appropriate
overtime rate. The minimum overtime payment in these circumstances will be three hours.

5.13 An employee (excluding AAD employees) required to undertake an overnight sea patrol will be paid a
taxable allowance as set out in Schedule 2 of this Agreement.

CAMPING ALLOWANCE
5.14 A camping allowance is payable for each night an employee (other than employees on, or preparing
for, a Period of Antarctic Duty) is required to camp. No part-day or hourly rate is payable for the
journey to the campsite. The employee will also be reimbursed for any camping fees that are required.
5.15 On the day of return from camping the employee is entitled to an additional camping allowance as set
out in Schedule 2 to this Agreement if they do not return to their normal locality until after 4.00 pm.

CADET ALLOWANCE
5.16 Cadet employees are entitled to an allowance, paid before the commencement of their course of
study, and to reimbursement for all compulsory study fees.

undertaking an approved course of study. The bursary is not payable to employees on leave without
pay except if this leave is for defence reserve purposes. There are two Study Bursary rates: one for
university-accredited coursework and the other for accredited coursework at a TAFE or similar
institution or other vocational institution. The maximum annual amounts for each of the study bursaries
are listed in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. Proportions of these annual amounts may be paid during a

23

12 month period based on the periods of study undertaken and on the successful completion of each
period of study. Further information is contained in the Department’s Study Support Scheme Policy.
5.20 The Delegate may approve some financial assistance to an employee before the completion of a
period of study on the grounds of financial hardship or to an employee who is unable to complete
coursework due to circumstances beyond their control.

unavailable to perform these duties for a period in excess of eight weeks.
5.24 Where an employee holds two or more roles listed in clause 5.22 they are only entitled to one
allowance. First Aid Officer and Emergency Warden roles may not be undertaken simultaneously, due
to conflicting role requirements in emergency situations.

OUTDOOR WORK ALLOWANCE
5.25 An employee whose specified duties include regular outdoor work (including rangers and
horticulturalists, but not Expeditioner employees) will receive the Outdoor Work Allowance. Further
information is contained in the Department’s Outdoor Work Allowance Policy. The Outdoor Work
Allowance counts as salary for all purposes.
5.26 Receipt of the Outdoor Work Allowance does not preclude an employee from receiving an allowance
for one or more of the roles listed in clause 5.22. Employees who were in receipt of the former Horticultural Allowance and First Aid Allowance in 2011 will continue to receive both the Outdoor Work Allowance and First Aid Allowance while they remain in the same workplace and retain the appropriate
First Aid qualification.

to attend work, overtime is payable for the portion of attendances extending beyond two hours. This
allowance does not count as salary for superannuation purposes.

MOTOR VEHICLE ALLOWANCE
5.31 Where the Delegate considers that it will result in greater efficiency or involve less expense, they may
authorise an employee to use a private car owned or hired by the employee at their own expense for
official purposes. This will be subject to the employee providing proof that, for the period of the
journey, they have comprehensive insurance on the vehicle, that the vehicle is registered, and that
they possess a current driver’s licence. In these circumstances an employee may claim a motor
vehicle allowance in accordance with the rates per business kilometre as specified by the Australian
Taxation Office.

TRAVEL EXPENSES
5.32 Employees required to travel for official work purposes will have their accommodation, meals and
other expenses met by the Department. Further information is contained in the Department’s Travel
Policy.
Administrative Changes for Travel
5.33 The Department will continue to improve administrative processes supporting travel arrangements.
These arrangements will continue to provide reasonable standards of accommodation, meals and incidentals. Special arrangements may be necessary in remote or regional areas. All arrangements will

separation from the Department. The details of what has been approved will be provided to the
employee in writing. An employee’s entitlement to receive a payment for relocation expenses must be
outlined in their letter of offer or in writing from the Delegate prior to the relocation. A Delegate may
then approve payment of reasonable costs associated with relocation from one locality to another
upon engagement, promotion, movement or separation. Further information is contained in the
Department’s Relocation Assistance Policy.

25

DEPENDANT CARE REIMBURSEMENTS
Vacation Assistance
5.36 Where an employee with school-age or preschool-age children has an application for annual leave or
purchased leave during school holidays cancelled for operational reasons, the employee may be
eligible for school holiday or childcare assistance. The maximum amount of this assistance is listed in
Schedule 2 as a per child per day rate.
Extra Dependant Care Costs
5.37 In recognition of dependant care responsibilities, the Delegate may authorise reimbursement of
reasonable expenses arising from additional dependant care arrangements that are necessary
because:
a. the employee is required to travel away from their normal work location for business purposes
b. the employee is directed to be on duty for additional periods outside the employee’s ordinary
hours of work or
c. other special circumstances exist that the Delegate considers justify the payment of reasonable
expenses arising from additional dependant care responsibilities.
5.38 Reimbursement of such expenses is subject to the employee obtaining prior approval from the
Delegate.
5.39 In cases of exceptional circumstances where an employee is required to travel with 24 hours or less

PART 6 – LEAVE PROVISIONS
PRINCIPLE
6.1

The Department is committed to a set of leave entitlements that are fair, based on mutual trust, and
provide all employees with adequate rest and support during times of need.

6.2

The Department recognises that both individuals and organisations benefit from parental and carer’s
leave being accessible to all employees regardless of gender, classification, or role.

6.3

All references to leave entitlements in Part 6 apply to full-time employees. Leave entitlements for
part-time employees will be a pro rata amount based on their part-time hours as outlined in their parttime agreement.

6.4

Wherever possible, prior approval for leave will be obtained and the type of leave disclosed. If an
employee is absent from duty without approval, all entitlements (including pay and allowances) and
other conditions provided under this Agreement (e.g. flexible working hours and flex leave) cease until
the employee resumes duty or is granted leave. Such absences do not count as service for any
purpose. Further information is contained in the Department’s Leave Policy.

PORTABILITY OF LEAVE
6.5

Where an employee joins the Department on or after the commencement of this Agreement from an
employer staffed under the PS Act or the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, or from the ACT
Government Service, accrued annual leave and personal/carer’s leave (however described) will be
transferred to the Department provided there is no break in continuity of service.

6.6

Leave transferred to the Department in accordance with clause 6.5 will be administered in accordance
with this Agreement.

Recognition of Prior Service
6.7

Where an employee has previously been employed in the APS, or in government service as defined in
section 10 of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, or a service referred to
in subsection 11(2) of that Act, they may also have that period of previous employment recognised as
service for personal/carer’s leave purposes, provided there has been no break in continuity of service
and the person did not receive a redundancy benefit at the end of the period of previous employment.

6.8

Accrued personal/carer’s leave credits that are recognised will be administered in accordance with this
Agreement.

ANNUAL LEAVE
6.9

Employees (excluding those receiving a casual loading) will accrue the equivalent of 20 days (150
hours) annual leave for each full year of service. Employees may apply to use their annual leave as it
accrues.

6.10 The taking of annual leave is subject to the prior approval of the Delegate. Approval is not to be
unreasonably withheld and, once given, is not to be unreasonably revoked. The Delegate will,
regardless of operational requirements, approve at least once per calendar year, an employee’s
annual leave application for a period of at least five consecutive working days.
6.11 Employees will, wherever practicable, regularly take their annual leave and will endeavour to ensure
that their accrued annual leave does not exceed two years of accrual. If an employee’s annual leave
credits exceed two years of accrual the employee, with the support of their Manager, must plan to
reduce their leave to less than two years of accrual as soon as possible.
27

6.12 Where an employee’s annual leave continues to exceed two years of accrual for three months or more
the Delegate may in the absence of a plan to reduce the accrued leave direct the employee to take a
period of annual leave.
6.13 The Delegate may grant an employee annual leave at either full or half pay, where sufficient credit is
available. When annual leave is granted on half pay, annual leave credits will be deducted at half the
full pay rate.
Cash-out of Annual Leave
6.14 There is no limit to the amount of annual leave that an employee may cash out, provided that the
employee’s remaining accrued entitlement to annual leave is not less than four weeks. Each cashing
out of a particular amount of annual leave must be made by a separate agreement in writing with the
Delegate. The employee will be paid the full amount that would have been payable to the employee
had the employee taken the leave that the employee is cashing out.
Cancellation of Annual Leave or Recall to Duty
6.15 Where an employee’s annual leave is cancelled without reasonable notice, or an employee is recalled
to duty, the employee will be entitled to be reimbursed reasonable travel costs and incidental
expenses not otherwise recoverable under any insurance or from any other source.
Additional Annual Leave for Shiftworkers
6.16 Employees who are working rostered Sunday duty are entitled to three hours and 45 minutes of
additional annual leave for every Sunday worked, up to an additional five days annual leave per year.
This applies only to shiftworkers on a standard roster, not to employees working overtime on Sunday.
Payment of Annual Leave Credits on Exit from APS
6.17 On separation from the APS an employee’s payment in lieu of any remaining annual leave entitlement
will be calculated using the employee’s final rate of salary and allowances considered as salary for all
purposes as at the date of exit. Temporary reassignment loading is regarded as salary for payment in
lieu of annual leave where it is certified that the temporary reassignment of duties would have
continued beyond the date of exit.

PURCHASED LEAVE
6.18 All employees (excluding those engaged on an irregular or intermittent basis, non-ongoing employees
employed for less than 12 months and Cadets) are eligible to apply for purchased leave. Further
information is contained in the Department’s Leave Policy.

LONG SERVICE LEAVE
6.19 An employee is eligible for long service leave in accordance with the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.
6.20 The minimum period during which long service leave can be taken is seven calendar days at full pay
or 14 calendar days at half pay. Long service leave cannot be broken with other periods of leave,
except as otherwise provided by legislation.
6.21 Except where an employee is on parental or maternity leave, an employee does not have an
unqualified right to access long service leave at any particular time, and the Delegate will consider
applications against operational requirements.

28

PERSONAL/CARER’S LEAVE
6.22 Employees (excluding those receiving a casual loading) will progressively accrue the equivalent of
20 days (150 hours) personal/carer’s leave for each full year of service.
6.23 Ongoing employees in their first 12 months of APS service can anticipate up to five days
personal/carer’s leave. Non-ongoing employees are eligible to anticipate an equivalent pro rata
amount of personal/carer’s leave Any anticipated leave will be offset against future accruals.
6.24 The Delegate may approve additional anticipated leave for employees in exceptional circumstances
where current personal/carer’s leave credits have been exhausted.
6.25 Any anticipated leave will be offset against future accruals. If an employee leaves the Department
before anticipated leave is offset, this will be treated as an overpayment of salary.
6.26 All personal/carer’s leave entitlements will be recorded and deducted in hours and minutes.
6.27 Personal/carer’s leave may be used for any period, including periods of one day or less. Employees
may elect to take personal/carer’s leave at half pay, in which case existing leave credits will be
deducted by half of the duration of the leave taken.
6.28 Personal/carer’s leave cannot be converted to salary and cashed out upon termination of employment.
6.29 Employees may take personal/carer’s leave for purposes of personal illness/injury, emergency caring
or support purposes, and for unexpected emergencies, including:
a.
b.
c.
d.

attending health appointments or accompanying a member of the employee’s family or
household or, where agreed by the Delegate, a close friend to a health appointment
care of a member of the employee’s family or household or, where agreed by the Delegate, a
close friend who is ill or requires assistance
attending to urgent household matters or repairs and
when the employee is unable to organise alternative care for their child or their usual childcare
arrangements are unexpectedly disrupted.

6.30 An employee must not use personal/carer’s leave (as defined in clause 6.29) for purposes not
included in the definition of personal/carer’s leave in the FW Act (Part 2-2, Division 7, Subdivision A) if
this would result in less than 10 days of the employee’s annual personal/carer’s leave being available
for use for personal injury or illness and caring as provided for under the FW Act.
Production of Supporting Evidence
6.31 Employees may be granted personal/carer’s leave with pay (subject to available credits) without
production of supporting evidence for absences of no more than three consecutive days. This period
will be extended to four days in localities that are long distances from a suitable doctor, subject to the
approval of the Delegate.
6.32 If the number of days without supporting evidence exceeds ten days in the preceding 12-month
period, the Delegate may require the employee to provide evidence for any further absences. The
Delegate must inform the employee in advance of any requirement for supporting evidence for further
absences.
6.33 A medical certificate from a registered health practitioner or provider supporting a period of absence
because of personal illness or injury or for caring responsibilities will be acceptable evidence for an
application for personal/carer’s leave. Where it is not reasonably practicable to provide a medical
certificate, a statutory declaration made by the employee may be acceptable. A statutory declaration
should provide a reasonable level of detail to allow the Delegate to assess the leave application.
6.34 Personal/carer’s leave will not be debited where an employee is medically unfit for duty on a public
holiday on which the employee would have otherwise been absent.
29

6.35 Periods of unpaid personal/carer’s leave will count for service for all purposes only if it has been
approved for reasons of personal illness or injury based on a medical certificate(s) from a registered
health practitioner or provider.
Access to Other Types of Paid Leave, While on Annual, Purchased or Long Service Leave
6.36 The Delegate may approve other types of leave (e.g. personal/carer’s leave) for an employee during a
period of their annual, purchased or long service leave subject to their eligibility and the production of
satisfactory evidence. The employee’s annual or purchased or long service leave will be re-credited to
the extent of any other eligible leave granted in its place.
Access While on Paid Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave or Foster Parent’s Leave
6.37 An employee will not be entitled to take paid personal/carer’s leave during periods of:
a.

paid leave under the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973

b.

paid Permanent Care leave

c.

paid adoption leave or

d.

Personal/Carer’s Leave to be Taken Before Termination on Invalidity Grounds
6.38 An employee will not, without the employee’s consent, be retired on invalidity grounds before the employee’s paid personal/carer’s leave credit has expired, except as otherwise provided by legislation.

COMPASSIONATE LEAVE (INCLUDING BEREAVEMENT)
6.39 Employees (other than those engaged on an irregular and intermittent basis) may take three days of
paid compassionate leave on each occasion when a member of the employee’s family or household:
a.

contracts or develops an illness that poses a serious threat to their life or

b.

sustains a personal injury that poses a serious threat to their life or

c.

dies.

6.40 Employees (other than those engaged on an irregular and intermittent basis) may take three or more
days of paid bereavement leave to attend a funeral, at the discretion of the Delegate.
6.41 Employees must provide documentary evidence to support any claims for leave of this nature within
14 days of the event. Such leave will count as service for all purposes.
6.42 An employee may take compassionate leave for a reason outlined in clause 6.39 as a single continuous three-day period or any separate periods to which the employee and their Manager agree.
6.43 An employee engaged on an irregular and intermittent basis is entitled to unpaid bereavement leave

the rate of three weeks per year) for treatment of the injury or illness as advised by a medical
practitioner.

may be eligible for unpaid parental leave subject to meeting the relevant requirements set out in
clause 6.63. An employee who initially takes unpaid parental leave but then completes 12 months continuous service at any time during the first 14 weeks of their parental leave, may be eligible for paid
parental leave for the remaining balance of the 14 week period subject to meeting the relevant requirements set out in clauses 6.52 to 6.60.
6.50 All parental leave types covered by clauses 6.52 to 6.66 must be taken in a single unbroken period
unless otherwise provided for under legislation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
6.51 All paid parental leave types will count as service for all purposes. For employees with less than 12
months continuous service in the APS, up to 14 weeks of unpaid parental leave will count as service.
Any additional unpaid parental leave will not count as service for any purpose other than for superannuation as set out in clause 4.55, or unless otherwise provided by legislation.
Paid Maternity Leave
6.52 Eligible employees covered by the ML Act are entitled to up to 12 weeks of paid maternity leave subject to the qualifying service requirements prescribed by the ML Act and administered as described in
clause 6.48. Where an employee qualifies for paid leave under the ML Act, this agreement provides
an additional two weeks paid leave.
Special Maternity Leave
6.53 An employee with no other entitlement to leave may be entitled to a period of unpaid leave (special
maternity leave) in accordance with Part 2-2, Division 5, Subdivision C of the FW Act if the employee
suffers from a pregnancy-related illness or their pregnancy ends within 28 weeks of the expected date
of birth of the child.
Adoption Leave, Foster Parent’s Leave and Permanent Care Leave
6.54 Employees are eligible for paid parental leave for adoption or long term care of a child when that child:
a.
b.
c.

is under 16 years of age and
did not previously live with the employee for a period of six months or more as at the day of
placement and
is not (otherwise than because of the adoption or fostering) a child or step child of the
employee or the employee’s partner.
31

6.55 The Delegate will grant 14 weeks full paid leave to eligible employees. Documentary evidence must
be provided.
6.56 This leave is not gender specific. For employee couples the nominated primary carer will be eligible for
14 weeks paid leave while the other partner may utilise supporting partner leave under clause 6.61.
Adoption Leave
6.57 Adoption leave will be approved for the purposes of:
a.
b.
c.

completing administrative and legal procedures (leave may be granted on more than one
occasion during this stage of the adoption process)
travelling to and returning from the location where the employee first accepts responsibility for
the adopted child and
recuperating with the child upon returning home.

6.58 Consistent with the Federal Government’s Closing the Gap Policy, traditional Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander adoption practices are recognised as equivalent to formal adoption and employees will
receive the same leave entitlements. This includes the Torres Strait Islander adoption Kupai Omasker
practices recognised by the Family Court of Australia.
Foster Parent’s Leave
6.59 Foster Parent’s leave will be approved for the purposes of assuming long-term responsibility arising
from the placement of a child in a ‘fostering’ arrangement by a person/organisation with statutory responsibility for the placement of the child.
Permanent Care Order Leave
6.60 Permanent Care leave will be approved for the purposes of caring for a child under a formal Permanent Care Order (PCO), long term care order or similarly termed order. Permanent Care leave will
only be approved for new PCOs where the child has not previously lived with the employee (e.g. under
a foster care arrangement or on a Permanent Care basis). If more than one child is placed with the
employee at or around the same time (e.g. siblings) under separate PCOs, the employee will only be
entitled to 14 weeks paid leave in respect of all of the children (not 14 weeks paid leave for each
child).
Supporting Partner Leave
6.61 The Delegate will grant ten days paid leave or 20 days leave at half pay to employees (on production
of satisfactory evidence) within 12 months following the birth of (or adoption of, or assumption of responsibility by Permanent Care order or fostering) a child. This provision is not applicable to employees who have utilised maternity, adoption, foster parents or Permanent Care Order leave for the same
child.
Half Pay Parental Leave
6.62 Employees have the option to spread the payment for all paid parental leave types up to double the
number of weeks at a rate of half the normal salary for the employee. When payment is spread at half
pay, any period beyond the first 14 weeks does not count for service, other than for superannuation as
set out in clause 4.55.
Unpaid Parental Leave
6.63 An employee is entitled to 12 months of unpaid parental leave if the leave is associated with:
a.

the birth of a child of the employee or the employee’s Spouse or de facto Partner or

b.

the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or

c.

the placement of a child with the employee for foster caring or
32

d.

the placement of a child with the employee under a permanent care order or

e.

the traditional adoption of a child by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander employee and

f.

the employee has or will have a responsibility for the care of the child.

6.64 Unpaid parental leave may be taken in conjunction with long service leave and/or annual leave.
Extending unpaid leave
6.65 On ending the initial 12 months of maternity or parental leave, employees may request an extension of
unpaid parental leave for a further period of up to 12 months. The second period of unpaid leave is to
commence immediately following the initial 12 months leave period.
6.66 A request made by a member of an employee couple (as defined in the FW Act) to extend their unpaid
parental leave must specify any amount of unpaid parental leave and unpaid special maternity leave
that the other member of the employee couple has taken, or will have taken, in relation to the child before the extension starts. The period of the extension cannot exceed 12 months and will be reduced by
any period of unpaid parental leave or unpaid special maternity leave that the other member of the
employee couple has taken, or will have taken, in relation to the child before the extension starts.
6.67 The requests referred to in clauses 6.65 and 6.66 must be in writing and submitted to the delegate at
least four weeks before the end of the available parental leave period. The delegate will respond to a
request in writing within 21 calendar days, either granting or refusing the request. If the request is refused, reasons for this decision must be provided to the employee. The delegate may refuse the request only on reasonable business grounds.
Return to Work from any type of Parental Leave
6.68 On ending any form of parental leave an employee is entitled to the return-to-work guarantee provided
by section 84 of the FW Act.

DEFENCE RESERVE LEAVE
6.69 An employee may be granted leave (with or without pay) to enable them to fulfil Australian Defence
Force (ADF) Reserve, Continuous Full Time Service (CFTS) or Cadet Force obligations. Note: The
Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001 requires the Department to release an employee who
is a Defence Reservist to undertake defence service and training.
6.70 An employee is entitled to leave with pay for up to four weeks each financial year, and an additional
two weeks paid leave in the first year of ADF Reserve service, for the purpose of fulfilling ADF Reserve service obligations.
6.71 With the exception of the additional two weeks in the first year of service, paid leave referred to in
clause 6.70 can be accumulated and taken over a period of two years.
6.72 An employee who is an officer or instructor of cadets in a Cadet Force may be granted paid leave for
up to three weeks each financial year to perform duties as an officer or instructor of cadets. For these
purposes ‘Cadet Force’ means the Australian Navy Cadets, Australian Army Cadets or Australian Air
Force Cadets.
6.73 Eligible employees may also apply for annual leave, long service leave, unlimited leave without pay or
top-up pay or they may use flextime or make up time, for the purpose of fulfilling ADF Reserve, CFTS
or Cadet Force obligations. Employees are not required to pay their tax free ADF Reserve salary to
the Agency in any circumstances.
6.74 Defence Reserve leave, except unpaid leave to undertake CFTS, counts as service for all purposes.
Unpaid leave for CFTS counts as service for all purposes except for annual leave accrual when the
period(s) of leave without pay exceed six months.
33

EMERGENCY SERVICES LEAVE
6.75 Employees who are members of recognised community service organisations will have access to paid
leave (on production of satisfactory evidence) for emergency services responses, regular training,
reasonable travel and recovery time and ceremonial duties. This will be limited to four days initially but
may be extended by the Delegate at the end of that period.

COMMUNITY SERVICE LEAVE
6.76 Employees are entitled to leave without pay to participate in eligible community services in accordance
with Division 8 of Part 2-2 of Chapter 2 of the FW Act.
6.77 The Delegate may grant a reasonable amount of leave without pay to undertake other community
volunteering for organisations registered with Volunteering Australia, subject to the operational
requirements of the employee’s workplace.
NAIDOC Ceremonies
6.78 Employees are entitled to up to one day of paid leave per calendar year to attend National Aborigines
and Islanders Day Observance Committee (NAIDOC) ceremonies.

ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER EMPLOYEES’ CEREMONIAL LEAVE
6.79 The Department is committed to the employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,
particularly in the jointly managed national parks, and recognises the traditional rights, roles and
obligations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees.
6.80 The Delegate may grant leave with or without pay to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees
for the purpose of participating in ceremonies relating to cultural practices, customs and traditions. The
maximum period of paid leave for this purpose in any calendar year is five days.
6.81 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employees’ ceremonial leave is subject to their Manager’s
approval. Employees must notify their Manager of their intention to be absent and, where possible, the
anticipated length of absence.
6.82 Employees may also access purchased, annual and flex leave for ceremonial purposes.
6.83 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees attending non-Department-sponsored NAIDOC
activities are eligible to apply for ceremonial leave and/or leave for NAIDOC ceremonies under clause
6.78.
6.84 In jointly managed national parks, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees may participate in
NAIDOC ceremonies in their communities as part of their normal working duties, subject to operational
demands.

CULTURAL, CEREMONIAL OR RELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONS
6.85 The Delegate may authorise up to two days of paid leave per annum for employees who apply for
leave to participate in cultural or ceremonial activities or to meet religious obligations, including
observance of religious holidays that are not formally designated as public holidays in the Agreement.
An employee may also request the substitution of a public holiday for these purposes as provided by
clause 3.38 of this Agreement.

STUDY LEAVE
6.86 Employees undertaking approved external studies, distance education and/or study activities related
only to the preparation and presentation of a thesis may apply for:
34

a.

leave with full pay to travel to and from and attend residential courses or seminars, or any
other compulsory study activities required for successful completion of the course of study and

b.

up to 42 hours leave with full pay each 6 month period in which approved study is undertaken.

6.87 Employees undertaking approved studies on the campus of a tertiary institution (i.e. not those covered
in clause 6.86 of this Agreement) may apply for up to 150 hours of leave with pay for each 12 month
period in which approved study is undertaken (subject to discussions with the Manager), to travel to
and from and attend approved study activities. Further information is contained in the Department’s
Study Support Scheme Policy.
6.88 Study leave without pay may be granted by the Delegate for a maximum period of 12 months to allow
employees to undertake full-time study. Periods of study leave without pay for periods longer than
12 months will be considered in exceptional circumstances. Study leave without pay does not count as
service for any purpose unless required by relevant legislation.

INDIGENOUS STUDY SUPPORT
6.89 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees may apply for up to 300 hours leave for each 12
month period in which the approved study activities are undertaken. Further information is contained in
the Department’s Study Support Scheme Policy.

OTHER LEAVE (WITH AND WITHOUT PAY)
6.90 Other leave with pay (for short periods only) or without pay may be approved by the Delegate for
purposes not provided for elsewhere in this Agreement. Leave without pay may be granted for a
maximum period of 12 months. Periods of leave without pay for periods longer than 12 months will be
considered in exceptional circumstances. Further information is contained in the Department’s Leave
Policy.
6.91 Leave without pay does not count as service for any purpose except as provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement or under the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, the
Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 or the Superannuation Act 2005.

35

PART 7 – WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
7.1

The Department will provide employees and their Family Members with access to a confidential, professional counselling service.

PROBATION
7.2

Probation may be imposed on the engagement of an employee, in accordance with section 22 of the
PS Act. The probation period is generally six months but the Delegate may set an alternative period of
probation where reasonable, having regard to the nature and circumstances of employment. Further
information is contained in the Department’s Probation Policy.

MANAGING PERFORMANCE
7.3

All employees covered by this Agreement (other than Expeditioner employees who are subject to
clauses 9.33 to 9.34, employees on irregular and intermittent contracts and non-ongoing employees
on contracts of less than three months) are required to participate in the Department’s Performance
and Development Scheme (PDS). The scheme aims to provide each employee with regular opportunities to discuss with their Manager performance expectations and the extent to which expectations
have been met. It also enables employees to discuss with their Manager their development needs for
both their current responsibilities and broader career development. Further information is contained in
the Department’s PDS Policy.

7.4

Employees are expected, as a minimum, to maintain a satisfactory standard of performance consistent
with their performance agreement. Where a Manager believes that an employee’s work performance
is unsatisfactory the Manager will work with the employee to address the causes of the unsatisfactory
performance. Where the employee’s performance does not improve to a satisfactory level the Manager may initiate formal underperformance management procedures. Further information is contained
in the Department’s Strengthening Performance Policy.

7.5

The Department’s formal underperformance procedures are designed to:
a.

restore the employee’s performance to a satisfactory standard in a timely way

b.

have regard to the individual circumstances of the employee, including any health issues

c.

ensure natural justice and procedural fairness

d.

respond to any learning and development needs where appropriate and

e.

ensure performance expectations, measures and standards are clearly defined.

TEMPORARY REASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES AT A HIGHER LEVEL
7.6

Where the Delegate decides to temporarily fill a vacancy for a period of five or more working days,
remuneration will be paid at the higher classification for the entire period of temporary reassignment of
duties if the vacancy is at a higher classification than the employee's substantive classification.

7.7

The additional remuneration for employees acting at a higher classification level will normally be
equivalent to the difference between the employee's salary at their substantive classification and the
minimum pay point of the higher classification. The Delegate may determine that a higher level of
additional remuneration is warranted having regard to the experience, qualifications and skills of the
employee or that a lower level of additional remuneration is appropriate where an employee is not
required to perform all the duties of the job at the higher classification.
36

7.8

Any additional remuneration will be paid during periods of leave or for a public holiday where the
Delegate determines that the employee would have continued on temporary reassignment of duties
but for the leave or the public holiday.

7.9

Where a temporary reassignment period is extended (and the extended period adjoins the initial
period), both periods will be regarded as one period.

Temporary Reassignment to SES Duties
7.10 Where a non-SES employee is temporarily assigned duties at the SES level or equivalent for a period
of five or more working days, the employee will be remunerated at the base rate of the SES Band 1
salary range. The Delegate may determine a higher level of additional remuneration or additional
benefits depending on the length of time the employee is acting at the SES level and/or the skills and
knowledge the employee brings to the role.

TEMPORARY REASSIGNMENT OF DUTIES AT A LOWER LEVEL
7.11 If an employee submits a written request to be temporarily reassigned the duties of a classification
lower than their substantive classification, the Delegate may agree to the request and reduce the
employee’s salary rate for a specified period and will provide their decision in writing.
7.12 The Delegate will give consideration to the Department’s operational requirements and the employee’s
reasons for requesting the temporary reassignment, including personal circumstances.

REDEPLOYMENT AND REDUNDANCY
7.13 The redeployment and redundancy provisions apply only to ongoing employees. They do not apply to
ongoing employees on probation or non-ongoing employees employed for a specified period or
specified task or on an irregular or intermittent basis.
7.14 When the Delegate is aware that an employee is likely to become excess, the Delegate will advise
them of the situation at the earliest practicable time.
7.15 The employee at any time may nominate a representative they wish to be involved in this matter, in
which case the Delegate will hold discussions with the employee and their representative.
7.16 The Delegate will advise employees who are formally declared as ‘excess to requirements’, as soon
as practicable.
7.17 Where an employee becomes excess or potentially excess the Delegate will discuss possible options
with them. Potentially excess employees may be placed on a local priority placement register. Excess
employees will be placed on a local priority placement register and may request to be placed on a
department-wide priority placement register. Employees on a priority placement register will be
considered for vacant ongoing positions at their substantive level, in isolation from and not in
competition with other applicants for an advertised vacant position. If an employee is considered
suitable they will be reassigned to the duties of the vacant position.
7.18 The claims of excess employees for ongoing positions at their substantive level will be considered
prior to any decision to notify vacancies in the Australian Public Service Gazette.
7.19 Employees who have been declared excess or have been formally advised that they are potentially
excess will be assisted to explore redeployment options.
7.20 The Delegate will take all reasonable steps, including appropriate training, consistent with the interests
of the efficient administration of the Department, to move an excess employee to a suitable vacancy at
the same level within the Department.

37

7.21 The Delegate may facilitate swaps at the same level between excess employees who wish to remain
employed and are assessed as suitable for available duties in the Department and employees who
wish to be considered for voluntary redundancy.
Accelerated Separation Arrangements
7.22 The Delegate may provide employees likely to be subject to the redundancy provisions of this
Agreement with an accelerated separation option. In addition to the severance benefit, this option
provides employees who have been identified as eligible to elect to accept voluntary redundancy and
whose employment comes to an end 14 days after their acceptance, an amount of ten weeks salary
(or 11 weeks salary for an employee over 45 years old with at least five years continuous service). The
payments made under this clause are inclusive of any statutory entitlement to payment in lieu of
notice.
7.23 This option is available to employees who exit from the Department prior to the commencement of any
formal consultation with employees and, if they choose, their nominated representatives.
7.24 Where an employee has elected not to accept an offer under this option, the standard redundancy
provisions of this Agreement, starting at clause 7.25, will then apply.
Voluntary Redundancy
7.25 Where the Delegate invites an excess employee to elect for voluntary redundancy, the employee will
have one month in which to make an election.
7.26 Within two weeks of the beginning of the month referred to in clause 7.25, an employee invited to elect
for voluntary redundancy will be given information on the following:
a.
b.
c.
d.

amount of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice and paid-up leave credits
options available to the employee concerning superannuation
taxation rules applying to the various payments and
amount available to assist the employee to seek financial advice.

This information is provided for guidance purposes only, and is not an offer capable of forming a
binding contract.
7.27 Where an election is made and the Delegate accepts the election, the Delegate will not give notice of
termination before the end of the one-month period referred to in clause 7.25, unless the employee
chooses to waive the remainder of the period.
7.28 Financial assistance will be provided (up to a maximum of $600) for financial advice.
7.29 Only one opportunity to elect for voluntary redundancy will be provided to an excess employee.
Period of Notice
7.30 If the employee elects for voluntary redundancy, the Delegate may terminate the employee’s
employment under section 29 of the PS Act. The Delegate will give four weeks’ notice (or five weeks
notice for an employee over 45 with at least five years of continuous service).
7.31 Where employment is terminated at the beginning of, or within, the notice period the employee will
receive payment in lieu of notice as set out in the FW Act for the unexpired portion of the notice period
as described in clause 7.30.
Redundancy Pay
7.32 An employee who elects for voluntary redundancy with a redundancy benefit and whose employment
is terminated by the Delegate under section 29 of the PS Act on the grounds that the employee is
excess to the requirements of the agency is entitled to payment of a redundancy benefit of an amount
equal to two weeks salary for each completed year of continuous service, plus a pro rata payment for
38

completed months of service since the last completed year of service, subject to any minimum amount
the employee is entitled to under the NES.
7.33 The minimum sum payable will be four weeks salary and the maximum will be 48 weeks salary.
7.34 The redundancy benefit will be calculated on a pro rata basis for any period when an employee has
worked part-time hours during their period of service and has less than 24 years full-time service,
subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the NES.
Service for Severance Pay Purposes
7.35 Service for severance pay purposes means:
a.
b.
c.

d.
e.

service in the Department
government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth
Employees) Act 1976
service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a joint Commonwealth–state body
corporate in which the Commonwealth does not have a controlling interest) which is
recognised for long service leave purposes
service with the Australian Defence Force and
service in another agency, where such service is recognised for long service leave purposes
and the employee was moved from the APS to that agency with a transfer of function or,
having been engaged by that agency on work within a function, the employee was appointed
as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS.

7.36 For earlier periods of service to count for severance pay purposes those periods must not have been
recognised for a previous severance payment and there must have been no breaks between the
periods of service, except where:
a.

b.

the break in service was for less than one month and occurred where an offer of employment
in relation to the second period of service was made and accepted by the employee before the
first period of service ended (whether or not the two periods of service are with the same
employer or agency) or
the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee was
deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under the repealed section 49 of the
Public Service Act 1922.

7.37 Absences from work that do not count as service for long service leave purposes will not count as
service for severance pay purposes.
Rate of Redundancy Payment
7.38 For the purpose of calculating any payment under clauses 7.32 to 7.37, salary will exclude allowances
that are reimbursements for expenses incurred or living allowances such as the Remote Locality
Allowance, but will include:
a.
b.

c.

d.

the employee’s salary at their substantive classification level or
for the purposes of long service leave in lieu, annual leave and severance, the salary of a
higher work value level at which the employee has been working for a continuous period of at
least 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the employee is given notice of the
termination of employment
shift penalties, where the employee has undertaken shiftwork and is entitled to shift penalties
for 50% or more of the pay periods in the 12 months preceding being given notice of
termination of employment. A weekly average of penalties due over the 12 months will be
included in the salary
other allowances in the nature of salary that are paid during periods of annual leave and on a
regular basis.

RETENTION PERIODS
7.39 An excess employee who does not elect for voluntary redundancy with the payment of a redundancy
benefit will be entitled to the following period of retention:
39

a.
b.

56 weeks if the employee has 20 or more years of service or is over 45 years old or
30 weeks for all other employees.

7.40 If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES the retention period at clause 7.39
will be reduced by the employee’s redundancy pay entitlement under the NES on termination,
calculated as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this clause).
Commencement of Retention Period
7.41 The retention period will commence on the earlier of the following:
a.
b.

the day the employee is advised in writing by the Delegate that they are an excess employee
or
one month after the day on which the Delegate invites the employee to elect for voluntary
redundancy under clause 7.25.

7.42 The retention period will be extended by any periods of certified personal/carer’s leave for purposes of
personal illness/injury taken during the retention period.
Employer Responsibilities
7.43 During the retention period the Delegate:
a.

will continue to take reasonable steps to find alternative employment for the excess employee,
including advising the employee of any APS employment opportunities known to the Delegate
and providing up to $5,000 for career transition support to be approved by the Delegate and

b.

may, with four weeks’ notice, move the excess employee to a job with a lower APS
classification. The employee will receive income maintenance to maintain their salary at the
previous higher level for the balance of the retention period.

Employee Obligations
7.44 During the retention period the employee will:
a.

take reasonable steps to find alternative employment and

b.

actively participate in learning and development activities, trial placements or other agreed
arrangements to assist in obtaining a permanent placement.

Assistance for Reasonable Incurred Expenses
7.45 An excess employee may request assistance in meeting reasonable travel and incidental expenses
incurred in seeking alternative employment if these are not met by the prospective employer.
7.46 Where an excess employee is required to move their household to a new locality as a result of a
movement or reduction in classification they will be entitled to reasonable expenses as determined by
the Delegate.

RETENTION PERIOD – EARLY TERMINATION
7.47 Where the Delegate is satisfied that there is insufficient productive work available for the employee
within the agency during the remainder of the retention period and that there are no reasonable
redeployment prospects in the APS:
a.

the Delegate may, with the agreement of the employee, terminate the employee’s employment
under section 29 of the PS Act and

b.

upon termination, the employee will be paid a lump sum comprising
i. payment for the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the NES under clause
7.40), which will be taken to include the payment in lieu of notice of termination of
employment and
ii. the employee’s NES entitlement to redundancy pay.

40

INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
7.48 Subject to clauses 7.49 to 7.50, the Delegate will, under section 29 of the PS Act, involuntarily
terminate the employment of an excess employee at the end of the retention period.
7.49 An excess employee will not have their employment terminated involuntarily if the employee has not
been invited to accept an offer of voluntary redundancy or if the employee has elected to have their
employment terminated but the Delegate has refused to approve it.
7.50 An excess employee will not have their employment terminated involuntarily without being given four
weeks’ notice (or five weeks’ notice for an employee over 45 with at least five years of continuous
service) of termination of employment, or payment in lieu of notice. These periods of notice will, as far
as practicable, be concurrent with the retention periods. The Department will provide notice of
termination of employment to each excess employee.

TERMINATION OF NON-ONGOING EMPLOYMENT
7.51 Clauses 7.52 to 7.53 apply to non-ongoing employees, other than Expeditioner employees.
7.52 Non-ongoing employment may be terminated for reasons other than misconduct, including (but not
limited to) where:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

the duties for which the employee was engaged are no longer available
the duties for which the employee was engaged have been completed ahead of time
a decision has been made that the duties for which the employee was engaged are no longer
required to be performed
there is unsatisfactory performance or
any other grounds as provided for in this Agreement.

7.53 Where the employment of a non-ongoing employee is terminated for reasons other than misconduct,
the Delegate may approve a payment to the employee at the applicable rate of pay in accordance with
Table 7.53.1. Such payment will be considered to include payment in lieu of any required period of
notice under section 117 of the FW Act, subject to payment meeting the minimum notice requirements
of that Act.

Code of Conduct will retain eligibility for relocation to their place of recruitment and removal of their
personal effects to the place of recruitment, if these conditions are included in their employment
contract or notice of engagement.

TERMINATION FOR MISCONDUCT
7.55 Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Delegate from terminating the employment of an employee for
serious misconduct, without further notice or payment in lieu, in accordance with the FW Act, subject
to compliance with the procedures established by the Secretary under section 15 of the PS Act for
determining whether an employee has breached the Code of Conduct.

RESIGNATION OR RETIREMENT
7.56 An employee will, where practicable, give a minimum of two weeks notice of their intention to resign or

PART 8 – REMOTE SUPPORT
REMOTE LOCALITIES ASSISTANCE
8.1

The Department recognises that employees working in remote and isolated localities require
assistance with the additional cost, inconvenience and physical and social isolation of living and
working at such locations. Accordingly all eligible employees will receive such assistance in line with
the provisions of this Agreement. If work is required to be performed in a remote location or unique
circumstances arise that are not considered in this Agreement, the Delegate will determine
appropriate allowances to be applied in accordance with this principle.

8.2

Employees stationed in the Department’s remote localities listed in Table 8.2.1 are eligible to receive
assistance in the form of:
a.

b.
c.

an annual Remote Localities Allowance (RLA) paid fortnightly at the rates specified for each

8.3

For the purposes of the RLA rates, LFA (clauses 8.15 to 8.18) and reunion fares for Darwin (clauses
8.19 to 8.21), an eligible Dependant is a Dependant (as defined in Part 10) who also:
a.

has ordinarily resided with the employee for the previous 12 months and

b.

receives an income, if any, less than the national minimum wage.

8.4

RLA does not count as salary for superannuation, long service leave in lieu or severance payment
purposes.

8.5

An employee with a Spouse/Partner who is also an employee of an APS agency and is entitled to RLA
will be regarded as an employee without Dependants for the calculation of the allowance.

Payment of RLA during Periods of Leave
8.6

The RLA will be paid during periods of personal/carer’s leave, annual leave, long service leave and
other paid leave. However, for long service leave the allowance is paid only if the employee resides in
the locality while on long service leave.

Payment of RLA for a Temporary Period
8.7

An employee may be paid RLA while temporarily stationed in a locality that would normally attract the
payment of RLA, if the Delegate considers this appropriate. In these circumstances RLA is generally
43

payable after the first 21 days. Further information is contained in the Department’s Travel Policy and
the Department’s Relocation Assistance Policy.
Former Remote Localities
8.8

Only employees who were employed at the Department’s former remote localities (as outlined in Table
8.8.1) will remain eligible, while they continue to work at those localities, to receive RLA as outlined in
Schedule 2, Table 8.8.1 and in accordance with the provisions of clauses 8.3 to 8.7 of this Agreement.

LEAVE FARES ASSISTANCE
8.15 Employees working in a remote locality for a continuous period of 12 months or more will be entitled to
receive LFA on an annual basis for themselves and their eligible Dependants who meet the conditions
of clause 8.3. The rates of LFA for each locality are specified in Schedule 2. LFA is not payable in
respect of a child under two years of age.
8.16 An employee’s LFA entitlement will become available 12 months after their commencement in the
remote locality and annually thereafter while the employee continues to work in a remote locality as
listed in Table 8.2.1.
8.17 LFA is payable only when an eligible employee takes at least five days annual leave away from the
remote locality. The Christmas shut-down period will count towards the required five days of annual
leave.
8.18 Employees who cease employment with the Department after working in a remote locality for a
continuous period of 12 months will be paid out for any unused LFA they became entitled to over the
last 24 months. In exceptional circumstances, the Delegate may agree to pay out such an employee
for any unused LFA they became entitled to over a period greater than the last 24 months.
Reunion Fares for New Recruits to Darwin
8.19 Ongoing employees engaged, moved, assigned or promoted to Darwin from another Australian
locality will be entitled to annual reunion fares assistance (RFA) for themselves and their eligible
Dependants who meet the conditions of clause 8.3. This provision does not apply to employees who
would be eligible for LFA as per clause 8.8 or clauses 8.15 to 8.18 for the same period.
8.20 An employee’s RFA entitlement will accrue 12 months after their commencement in Darwin and
annually thereafter while the employee continues to work in Darwin, and will be payable when the
employee takes annual leave to return to the State or Territory from which they were recruited.
8.21 The rates of RFA for each State and Territory are specified in Schedule 2. No RFA is payable in
respect of a child under two years of age.
Medical or Dental Treatment – Reimbursement of Transport Costs
8.22 Employees working in a remote locality will be entitled to reimbursement of reasonable travel costs, as
determined by the Delegate, for medical or dental treatment where:
a. it is immediately necessary for the employee or a Dependant of the employee to travel from the
remote locality for medical, dental or specialist treatment because the relevant service is
unavailable at the remote locality and
b.

a qualified medical practitioner, dentist or medical specialist certifies the immediate necessity
and essential nature of this treatment.

45

8.23 If the employee or their Dependant accesses similar payments or services provided under provisions
of another government subsidy or by another APS agency, the amount of assistance provided by the
Department will be reduced by the amount received by the employee accessing the assistance.
Emergency or Compassionate Travel – Reimbursement of Transport Costs
8.24 Where:
a. an employee or Dependant of an employee is stationed at a remote locality and
b.

it is necessary for the employee or a Dependant of the employee to travel from the locality for
emergency or compassionate reasons (i.e. where a close Family Member becomes critically or
dangerously ill or dies, or in other crisis situations approved as such by the Delegate)

the Delegate will authorise reimbursement of reasonable costs incurred for return transport by air
(through the Department’s travel management provider where possible) or surface travel within
Australia to the locality where the close Family Member lives (or lived immediately before his or
her death). However, if that locality is in another country, the Delegate will authorise
reimbursement of the reasonable cost of travel to the closest Australian capital city international
airport that has reasonable flight connections to that locality.
Reunion Travel for School Children
8.25 Where a dependent child of an ongoing employee stationed in a remote locality listed in Table 8.2.1
who ordinarily lives with the employee is receiving primary or secondary education at a school in a
locality other than where the employee is stationed and, as a result, does not live with the employee,
the Delegate will approve reunion travel for the child to visit the employee. Travel may be between the
locality where the employee is stationed and the locality where the child is receiving education. Travel
should normally be booked through the Department’s travel management provider.
8.26 Where it is not possible to book travel through the travel management provider, the employee will be
reimbursed as follows:
a. if the child travels from the locality where he or she is receiving education to the locality where
the employee is stationed, an amount equal to the cost of return fares reasonably incurred by
the employee or
b. if the child travels from the locality where he or she is receiving education to a locality other than
where the employee is stationed to visit the employee or the Spouse/Partner of the employee,
an amount equal to the lesser of the cost of return fares reasonably incurred by the employee
and the amount that would have been reimbursed if the child had travelled to the locality where
the employee is stationed.
8.27 Reunion travel will be limited to three return fares per dependent child during a school year. The
Delegate may approve an additional reunion visit if:
a.
b.
c.

the child has already been authorised for three return fares in a year
the child attends a school that has four terms in a school year and
the Delegate is satisfied that there are special circumstances requiring an additional reunion
visit.

8.28 Each dependent child away at school who would otherwise normally reside with an employee at a remote locality will also be entitled to an annual leave fare, as provided for at clauses 8.15 – 8.18.
Correspondence School Travel Assistance
8.29 Where a dependent child of an ongoing employee stationed in a remote locality who lives with the
employee and is studying at primary or secondary school level by correspondence is required to travel
to another location as part of their course of study, the Delegate may approve reimbursement of
airfares on up to three occasions during a school year.

46

Additional Travel Leave for Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands Employees
8.30 The Delegate may grant up to an additional five days paid leave per calendar year to employees on
Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This leave may be taken in the following
circumstances:
a. for travel time when employees are required to travel for medical, specialist, dental, emergency
or compassionate reasons using personal/carer’s leave and/or
b. where a scheduled flight they are booked to travel on during any other paid leave is cancelled,
delayed or unable to complete its service (due to, for example, atmospheric conditions or
mechanical breakdown). Supporting evidence from the air carrier will be required.
Re-crediting of Annual Leave for Annual Medical Examinations
8.31 Employees who return from annual leave having had an annual medical examination will be recredited one day of annual leave and have one day of personal/carer’s leave subsequently deducted
from their leave balance. Employees will be required to produce supporting evidence (e.g. a medical
certificate) to claim this entitlement.

47

PART 9 – ANTARCTIC DUTY PROVISIONS
9.1

All employees required to participate in Periods of Antarctic Duty will be subject to the conditions of
Part 9 of this Agreement. Where a distinction needs to be made, employees on Antarctic duty are
referred to as either:
a.

Expeditioner employees: those whose work is predominantly performed in Antarctica and who

b.

are identified as such by the Delegate or
Head Office employees: those whose work is predominantly performed in Head Office but who
are required to undertake a Period of Antarctic Duty as part of their role.

9.2

Head Office employees will be considered to be Expeditioner employees if they have applied for the
Expeditioner employee role and it is not deemed to be part of their normal Head Office duties. A Head
Office employee undertaking duties as an Expeditioner employee will be paid at the relevant salary
rate, except for in the circumstances outlined in clause 9.3.

9.3

Where a Head Office employee is requested by the Delegate to undertake duties as an Expeditioner
employee at a lower pay level, they will continue to be paid at their Head Office rate of salary.

9.4

Employees who are undertaking a Period of Antarctic Duty at the commencement of this Agreement
will not receive a reduction in any of their terms and conditions (as a result of changes to conditions in
this Agreement) for the duration of that Period of Antarctic Duty.

Expeditioner Employees Classifications
9.5

The classifications applicable to Expeditioner employees are detailed in Schedule 4 of this Agreement.

9.6

Expeditioner Antarctic Medical Practitioner (EAMP) employees will be engaged at a specific
classification level depending on the qualifications and experience that they have attained, as
determined by the Delegate. Further information is contained in the Department’s Antarctic Medical
Practitioners Classification Policy.

Working Hours
9.7

The requirements of Antarctic duty vary such that employees are regularly required to work additional
hours beyond an average 37 hours and 30 minutes per week. The additional hours required will be
reasonable, as determined in accordance with section 62(3) of the FW Act.

9.8

Extended hours of work are required for a variety of reasons in addition to the work demands
associated with the employee’s primary responsibility while in Antarctica, including the provision of
support to the community, effects of weather on programmed work, required training, emergency
situations and unloading of ships. These requirements are compensated by the Antarctic Duty
Allowances as set out in Schedule 2 of this Agreement and by other benefits.

9.9

Station, voyage and field leadership teams are responsible for the management of working hours in
accordance with sound workplace health and safety practices including fatigue management.

Training in Support of Antarctic Duty
9.10 It is mandatory for all employees to participate, and be assessed as competent, in nominated training
activities and courses conducted or coordinated by the Department during the pre-departure period, in
support of their Period of Antarctic Duty. This training includes (but is not limited to) safety and survival
and nominated trade, professional or community training.
Marine Science Participation
9.11 Employees will not be required to participate in voyages or undertake duty requiring diving in
Antarctica in more than two seasons out of three consecutive seasons.

48

9.12 Employees will not be required to participate for more than 180 days in combined duty at sea and
diving duty, over three consecutive seasons, except that, where an operational need arises, 180 days
may be exceeded by agreement between the employee and management. Employees may agree to
work additional days at sea in any season.
9.13 Voyages of five days or less are excluded from calculations for clause 9.12 and will not be considered
as Periods of Antarctic Duty. Employees who are not entitled to overtime payments for these voyages
will instead receive Antarctic Duty Allowances in accordance with the relevant clauses.

ANTARCTIC DUTY ALLOWANCES
9.14 During Periods of Antarctic Duty, together with their base salary (as specified in Schedule 4 of this
Agreement), employees will be paid Antarctic Duty Allowances in accordance with clauses 9.16 to
9.28 and as set out in Schedule 2.
9.15 Rates of payment of Antarctic Duty Allowances will be as per Schedule 2 of this Agreement, per
annum, pro rata.
Allowance in Lieu of Overtime
9.16 During a Period of Antarctic Duty, employees will be paid an Allowance in Lieu of Overtime. Payment
of the allowance is in recognition of the performance of primary duties that might, in other situations,
be compensated by overtime, penalty, shift, roster, call-out, restriction, supplementary leave loading or
other like payments.
Common Duties Allowance
9.17 During a Period of Antarctic Duty, employees will be paid a Common Duties Allowance. Payment of
the allowance is in recognition of the reasonable additional duty necessary to the functioning of an
Expedition, including assisting other Expedition members, whether employees or otherwise, with
official Expedition programs and other general duties necessary for the community life of the
Expedition; such duties are unrelated to the primary duties.
Antarctic Allowance
9.18 During a Period of Antarctic Duty, employees will be paid an Antarctic Allowance. Payment of the
allowance is in recognition of working requirements and circumstances that might, in other situations,
be compensated by functional, site, disability or other like allowances. The allowance is also in
recognition of remoteness, isolation, weather, social debt, living conditions, lack of amenities, all forms
of transportation and all other environmental factors associated with Antarctica.
Loading on Antarctic Duty Allowances
9.19 Where, at the direction of the Delegate, an employee is required to work in the circumstances detailed
in clause 9.20 for at least seven consecutive days, an additional loading of 40 per cent of the Antarctic
Duty Allowances being received will be paid.
9.20 Clause 9.19 will apply in the following circumstances:
a.

working at Wilkins Aerodrome or

b.

working in a ‘deep field’ situation (e.g. an ice drilling program or traverse) or

c.

performing rostered Marine Science Technical Support duty at sea for a minimum of 10 hours
per day exclusive of meal breaks.

49

Basis of Calculation
9.21 Antarctic Duty Allowances will be paid fortnightly, with salary, from the Day of Embarkation until the
Day of Disembarkation, using the formula:
Fortnightly rate = annual allowance rate x 12 / 313.
th

9.22 The daily rate of the allowance is 1/14 of the fortnightly rate.

OTHER ANTARCTIC ALLOWANCES
Wintering Expeditioner Employees
9.23 Employees whose expected Period of Antarctic Duty includes midwinter’s day (21 June) will be paid a
Wintering Allowance for their entire Period of Antarctic Duty. Payment of the allowance is in
recognition of the additional responsibilities carried by wintering employees in supporting the
community through involvement in other essential roles that are not related to the performance of their
primary role (e.g. fire and/or search and rescue teams, call-outs and related restriction) and that are
not generally undertaken by non-wintering employees. Payment of the allowance will be as per
Schedule 2 of this Agreement, per annum, pro rata.
Returning Expeditioner Employees
9.24 Subject to clauses 9.25 to 9.27, an employee who is re-engaged by the Department as an
Expeditioner employee will be paid an allowance in recognition of their level of skills, experience and
training. The allowance will be paid per annum, pro rata.
9.25 The annual amount of the allowance will be determined by the previous number of eligible seasons of
employment as an Expeditioner employee, as set out in Schedule 2 of this Agreement.
9.26 For the purposes of this allowance:
a.

an eligible season is an Antarctic season (October to October) during which the employee
completed one or more eligible periods of duty and

b.

an eligible period of duty is a minimum six-week continuous Period of Antarctic Duty.

9.27 Eligible seasons will only count towards receipt of the allowance when the end of the most recent
eligible period of duty is within a three-year period of the commencement of the current Period of
Antarctic Duty.
Higher Rate of Salary for Returning Expeditioner Employees
9.28 The Delegate may offer a returning Expeditioner employee a salary at the next higher pay point in
their classification (Schedule 4 refers) to the pay point they received in their last Period of Antarctic
Duty if they are
a.

re-engaged within a 3 year period of the completion of their previous Period of Antarctic Duty

b.

re-engaged in the same role as they were engaged in previously

c.

had not already received the highest pay point in their classification for their last Period of Antarctic Duty and

d.

had performed better than satisfactorily during their last Period of Antarctic Duty.

ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES ALLOWANCE
9.29 Where the Delegate assigns to an employee one or more of the following roles:
a.

Deputy Station Leader

50

b.

Deputy Field Leader of a remote field group where the Field Leader reports directly to the
Operations Manager (AAD)

c.

Boat Master – Macquarie Island

d.

Search and Rescue Leader

e.

Fire Chief

the employee will be paid an allowance in accordance with Schedule 2 of this Agreement, per annum,
pro rata for the period of performance of that role.
Public Holidays
9.30 Public holidays will normally be observed but there may be occasions when employees will be
required or requested to work on these days for operational reasons. Public holidays within Australia
are defined at clause 3.36 of this Agreement. The station/field/voyage leader and affected employees
will agree on another day being substituted if an employee is required to work on a public holiday.
Superannuation
9.31 The applicable salary rate is considered to be salary for superannuation purposes. Allowances
specified at clauses 9.16 to 9.19, 9.23, 9.24 and 9.29 will be considered to be salary for
superannuation purposes, subject to the rules of the applicable superannuation scheme and prevailing
legislation.
Deductions from Pay
9.32 During a Period of Antarctic Duty, personal expenses of the employee incurred by the Department on
their behalf (e.g. personal telephone charges) will be repaid by the employee as soon as possible by
deduction from their pay.

MANAGING PERFORMANCE
Performance Appraisal
9.33 All employees who undertake Antarctic duty for a period of six weeks or more, or who are participating
in a voyage in either a voyage support role or Marine Science Technical Support capacity, must
participate in the Expeditioner Performance Appraisal Scheme (EPAS).
9.34 The EPAS uses the Antarctic Service Code of Personal Behaviour (the Antarctic Service Code) as the
basis for assessment of performance. It is designed to facilitate objective recording of the behaviours
exhibited by employees during Expedition participation.
Conduct and Behaviour
9.35 All employees participating in an Expedition must comply, and encourage compliance by others, with
the APS Code of Conduct and the Antarctic Service Code.
9.36 All employees on Antarctic duty must comply with the general standard of behaviour that is recognised
as reasonable by the wider Australian community and must meet the additional standards of
behaviour outlined in the Antarctic Service Code.
9.37 The Antarctic Service Code is not intended to be specific or exhaustive on issues of personal
behaviour. The absence of an issue from the Antarctic Service Code does not mean that a certain act
or omission is acceptable. The Antarctic Service Code outlines broad standards of behaviour that
serve as a guide to acceptable and unacceptable behaviour on Antarctic service.
9.38 An employee may, during Pre-departure Preparation and Training or a Period of Antarctic Duty, be
withdrawn by the Delegate from further participation in that Period of Antarctic Duty for reasons of

51

misconduct. Further information is contained in the Department’s Antarctic Duty Conduct and
Behaviour Policy.
Withdrawal from Antarctic Duty – Reasons other than Misconduct
9.39 An employee may, during Pre-departure Preparation and Training or a Period of Antarctic Duty, be
withdrawn by the Delegate from further or expected participation, for reasons other than misconduct.
This may occur where:
a.

the employee has been unable to adapt to the work or social conditions at the Department or
in Antarctica

b.

the employee has failed to meet the Department’s expectations for training and preparation for
a Period of Antarctic Duty

c.

the employee is no longer operationally required by the Department

d.

continued participation by the employee would be likely to increase the risk of an unproductive
environment in the workplace or negatively affect the interaction between other members of
the Expedition or

e.

medical and/or adaptability conditions develop or become apparent after the commencement
of employment.

Termination of Expeditioner Employment – Reasons other than Misconduct
9.40 Non-ongoing Expeditioner employees who are withdrawn from further participation for reasons other
than misconduct may have their employment terminated on a date determined by the Delegate. That
date will be no earlier than their date of disembarkation.
9.41 The Delegate may in these cases approve a payment to the employee at the applicable salary rate,
together with Antarctic Duty Allowances, in accordance with Table 7.53.1. Antarctic Duty Allowance
will be included if the employee was receiving that allowance prior to withdrawal. Such payment will be
considered to include payment in lieu of any required period of notice under section 117 of the FW
Act, subject to meeting the minimum notice requirements of that Act.
9.42 Expeditioner employees withdrawn from further participation for reasons other than misconduct will
retain (where applicable) eligibility for relocation, and for removal of their personal effects, to their
place of recruitment.

LEAVE AND ADDITIONAL TIME OFF
Personal/Carer’s Leave
9.43 Expeditioner employees may access personal/carer’s leave in accordance with Part 6 of this
Agreement while in Australia. While in Antarctica, Expeditioner employees may take personal/carer’s
leave if they are ill or injured (medical certification may be required) with no loss of pay or reduction in
their personal/carer’s leave credits.
Annual Leave
9.44 Annual leave will not be granted during a period of Antarctic duty, due to operational requirements
associated with living and working in Antarctica.
9.45 On ceasing employment, Expeditioner employees will be paid out for any remaining accrued annual
leave entitlement. The Antarctic Duty Allowances and Wintering Allowance are not payable in respect
of any period of annual leave taken or paid in lieu.
9.46 Head office employees will accrue additional annual leave for a period of Antarctic duty. This
additional annual leave will be calculated as follows:

52

Additional annual leave in hours = (A x 37.5 x 4)/number of days in a calendar year
(where ‘A’ represents the number of days in a period of Antarctic duty).
Pre-Departure Leave
9.47 The Delegate may grant up to five weekdays for the purpose of pre-departure leave to Expeditioner
employees, subject to operational requirements. The Delegate may extend this period for operational
reasons.
Recuperation Leave
9.48 At the direction of the Delegate some employees may be required to work extended or prolonged
hours away from station during a Period of Antarctic Duty (e.g. working at Wilkins Aerodrome or on a
drilling program, marine science, or traverse). Employees will be eligible for recuperation leave if they
are required to perform eligible duty. For the purpose of recuperation leave and additional time off,
eligible duty is duty performed:
a. seven days per week
b. on average a minimum of ten hours per day
c. for a minimum of seven consecutive days and
d. in one or more of the following locations/situations
i.

Wilkins Aerodrome

ii.

deep field

iii.

marine science activity and/or

iv.

other situations as determined by the Delegate.

9.49 Where an employee working at Wilkins Aerodrome or a deep field camp moves to a station for a
period of less than one week, this will not break continuity for the purposes of clause 9.48.
9.50 In recognition of eligible duty, employees must take time off for recuperative purposes to minimise the
risk of ill health, fatigue and personal injury.
9.51 The time off that may be taken for recuperative purposes is calculated at the rate of one day for each
completed period of seven days of eligible duty, up to a maximum of five days.
9.52 Managers must ensure that time off for recuperative purposes commences within three days of
completing a program of essential work. In the case of field Expeditions, an employee’s time off may
commence upon return to the station, or as soon as practicable upon return to Australia.
9.53 Time off for recuperative purposes must be taken as time off from duty. It cannot be converted to
payment or added to annual leave or other forms of leave.
9.54 Where employment is due to cease before employees have had the opportunity to take time off from
duty for the required period, employment contracts will be extended by the amount of time off not
taken (and the time off must be taken).
Additional Time Off
9.55 In further recognition of eligible duty, employees will be granted time off without deduction from leave
credits, calculated at the rate of one working day for each completed seven days of eligible duty, to a
maximum of five working days.
9.56 Additional time off is to be taken at the earliest practical opportunity by agreement between the
employee and their Manager. In the case of a field Expedition, an employee may take additional time
off while on station.

53

9.57 Additional time off must be taken within three months of the employee’s return to Australia; otherwise
the employee’s entitlement to additional time off will be lost.
9.58 Where employment contracts are due to be completed earlier than three months after the employee’s
return to Australia and before the employee has had the opportunity to take the additional time off for
the required period, payment in lieu of the amount of additional time off not taken will be made.

COVERAGE OF MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES
9.59 As determined by the Delegate, the Department will cover a range of reasonable expenses for
employees associated with their undertaking a period of Antarctic duty. The expenses covered may
include those associated with travel, accommodation, meals, transport and storage of personal and
household effects, storage of a motor vehicle, training and protective clothing and equipment. The
Department will also provide a range of amenities including access to communication services for
employees while they are in Antarctica as determined by the Delegate. Further information is
contained in the Department’s Antarctic Duty Expeditioner Support Policy.

EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
9.60 The Department provides expeditioner employees and their immediate families with access to an
independent, confidential, and professional counselling service at no cost to the employee, from the
date of commencement until six months after the expeditioner employee’s return from a period of
Antarctic duty.

SCHEDULE 5 – SUPPORTED WAGE SYSTEM
This schedule defines the conditions that will apply to employees who, because of the effects of a disability,
are eligible for a supported wage under the terms of this Agreement.
In this schedule:
Approved Assessor means a person accredited by the management unit established by the
Commonwealth under the Supported Wage System to perform assessments of an individual’s productive
capacity within the Supported Wage System.
Assessment Instrument means the tool provided for under the Supported Wage System that records the
assessment of the productive capacity of the person to be employed under the Supported Wage System
Disability Support Pension means the Commonwealth Government pension scheme to provide income
security for persons with a disability as provided under the Social Security Act 1991, as amended from time
to time, or any successor to that scheme.
Relevant Minimum Wage means the minimum wage prescribed in this Agreement for the class of work for
which an employee is engaged.
Supported Wage System (SWS) means the Commonwealth Government system to promote employment
for people who cannot work at full award wages because of a disability, as documented in the Supported
Wage System Handbook (available from the Job Access website www.jobaccess.gov.au).
SWS Wage Assessment Agreement means the document in the form required by the Department of
Employment that records the employee’s productive capacity and agreed wage rate.
Eligibility Criteria
Employees covered by this schedule will be those who are unable to perform the range of duties to the
competence level required within the class for which the employee is engaged under this Agreement,
because of the effects of a disability on their productive capacity, and who meet the impairment criteria for
receipt of a Disability Support Pension.
The schedule does not apply to any existing employee who has a claim against the Department which is
subject to the provisions of workers compensation legislation or any provision of this Agreement relating to
the rehabilitation of employees who are injured in the course of their employment.
Supported Wage Rates
Employees to whom this clause applies will be paid the applicable percentage of the Relevant Minimum
Wage according to the following schedule, provided that the minimum amount payable must be not less than
the amount set in the National Minimum Wage Order for supported wage rates.

Where an employee’s assessed capacity is 10%, they must receive a high degree of assistance and support.
Assessment of Capacity
For the purposes of establishing the percentage of the Relevant Minimum Wage, the productive capacity of
the employee will be assessed in accordance with the Supported Wage System by an Approved Assessor,
70

having consulted the Department and the employee and, if the employee so desires, a union which the
employee is eligible to join.
Assessment made under this schedule must be documented in an SWS Wage Assessment Agreement and
retained by the employer as a time and wages record in accordance with the Act.
Lodgement of SWS Wage Assessment Agreement
All SWS Wage Assessment Agreements under the conditions of this schedule, including the appropriate
percentage of the Relevant Minimum Wage to be paid to the employee, must be lodged by the Department
with the Fair Work Commission.
All SWS Wage Assessment Agreements must be agreed and signed by the employee and the Department.
Where a union that has an interest in this Agreement is not a party to the assessment, the assessment will
be referred by the Fair Work Commission to the union by certified mail. The agreement will take effect unless
an objection is notified to the Fair Work Commission within 10 working days.
Review of Assessment
The assessment of the applicable percentage should be subject to annual review or to more frequent review
on the basis of a reasonable request for such a review. The process of review must be in accordance with
the procedures for assessing capacity under the Supported Wage System.
Other Terms and Conditions of Employment
Where an assessment has been made, the applicable percentage will apply to the relevant wage rate only.
Employees covered by the provisions of the schedule will be entitled to the same terms and conditions of
employment as all other workers covered by this Agreement, paid on a pro rata basis.
Workplace Adjustment
An employer wishing to employ a person under the provisions of this schedule must take reasonable steps to
make changes in the workplace to enhance the employee’s capacity to do the job. Changes may involve
redesign of job duties, working time arrangements and work organisation in consultation with other workers
in the area.
Trial Period
In order for an adequate assessment of the employee’s capacity to be made, the Department may employ a
person under the provisions of this schedule for a trial period not exceeding 12 weeks, except that in some
cases additional work adjustment time (not exceeding four weeks) may be needed.
During that trial period the assessment of capacity will be undertaken and the percentage of the Relevant
Minimum Wage for a continuing employment relationship will be determined.
The minimum amount payable to the employee during the trial period must be no less than the amount set in
the National Minimum Wage Order for supported wage rates.
Work trials should include induction or training as appropriate to the job being trialled.
Where the employer and the employee wish to establish a continuing employment relationship following the
completion of the trial period, a further contract of employment will be entered into based on the outcome of
the assessment.
