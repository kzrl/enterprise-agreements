Part C – Employment classification structure
29.

The department’s classification structures and broadbands are detailed in Attachments A, B, C
and D.

Department’s Training Broadband
30.

The department’s Training Broadband at Attachment B is used for those employees required to
undertake a mandatory training or development programme as a condition of advancement to the
next classification within the broadband. Salary progression is subject to successful completion of
that programme.

31.

The Secretary may assign other classifications to the department’s Training Broadband relevant to
the training and development programme being undertaken by an employee or to ensure
consistency with whole of government approaches.

Education and Training Graduates
32.

Graduates will enter the department at the APS 3 classification level within the department’s
Training Broadband. On successful completion of the Graduate Programme, Graduates will be
advanced to the APS 4 classification level within the Training Broadband, and then be moved at the

Cadets
33.

Employees recruited as a Cadet will undertake a course of study as determined by the Secretary.
Cadets will be assigned a classification level within the department’s Training Broadband.

be assessed for advancement to the APS 3 classification level within the department’s Broadband 1.

Trainee APS (Administrative)
34.

Trainee APS (Administrative) employees will be assigned a classification within the department’s
Training Broadband and undertake a course of study determined by the Secretary. On successful
completion of their training requirements, the classification of Trainee APS (Administrative) will be
not less than the APS 3 classification level, subject to work being available at the APS 3 level.

Ongoing movement within a broadband
35.

Permanent movement between classification levels within a broadband applies to ongoing
employees only.

36.

Movement to a higher APS classification level within a broadband is not automatic and can only
occur when:

that classification and
b. the employee’s performance is assessed as meeting the requirements for salary advancement
for both key business deliverables and observable work behaviours and
c. the employee demonstrates an ability to undertake the higher level work, and if appropriate has
the necessary qualifications, skills and/or experience or

Part D – Remuneration
Salary
37.

The salary rates are detailed in Attachments A, B, C and D of this Agreement.

Salary increases
38.

Salary rates for employees, who immediately prior to the commencement of this Agreement, were
on former DEEWR Enterprise Agreement 2012–2014 salary points will increase by:
a. 2.5% on commencement
b. 2% 12 months after commencement
c. 1% 24 months after commencement.

39.

Employees, who immediately prior to the commencement of this agreement were under the terms
and conditions of the One Innovation Enterprise Agreement 2011, will be aligned to the salary rates
in Attachment A in accordance with Attachment E.

40.

Employees, who immediately prior to the commencement of this Agreement were on former
Department of Social Services Enterprise Agreement 2015–2018 salary rates, will be aligned to the
salary points in Attachment A in accordance with Attachment F.

41.

Employees, whose salary rate is above the rates for their classification in Attachment A on
commencement of this Agreement, will remain on that salary until their salary falls within the salary
rates for their classification.

Salary payment
42.

An employee will be paid fortnightly in arrears by electronic funds transfer into a financial institution
account of the employee’s choice.

43.

The fortnightly rate of salary is calculated using the following formula: annual rate of salary,
multiplied by twelve, and divided by 313.

Salary on engagement, promotion or movement
44.

A person who is engaged to the APS by the department, an existing ongoing APS employee
promoted or moved to the department, or an existing departmental ongoing employee promoted or
moved within the broadband in the department, will be paid at the minimum salary of the relevant
classification unless the Secretary approves payment of a higher salary within the salary range for
that classification.

45.

An ongoing employee, who immediately before a movement within the broadband or promotion,
is in receipt of Temporary Performance Loading (TPL) above the base salary due to receiving salary
advancement at the TPL classification under the salary advancement provisions of this EA, will be
paid at the higher TPL salary rate from the date of promotion or movement.

46.

Unless the Secretary determines a higher salary, an existing ongoing APS employee moving to the
department at the same classification level, whose salary immediately prior to transfer is below the
maximum salary in the department for that APS classification, will have their salary rates set within
the salary range for that classification at a rate closest to, but no lower than the existing salary.

47.

Unless the Secretary determines otherwise, an existing ongoing APS employee moving to the
department at the same classification level, whose salary in their previous APS agency exceeds the
maximum salary in the department for that classification, will be maintained on that salary until
such time as the salary differential is absorbed by departmental salary increases at the relevant
classification level.

48.

Where an ongoing employee’s salary exceeds the maximum salary range at the relevant
departmental classification level and is set by an Individual Flexibility Arrangement (IFA) under an
enterprise agreement or an instrument other than an enterprise agreement, the Secretary will
determine the salary on movement to the department.

49.

Clauses 44-48 do not apply to a departmental employee returning to the department following
a temporary movement with another agency.

50.

If an employee’s salary is set in error at the time of engagement or promotion, the Secretary may
subsequently determine that the employee’s salary may be adjusted within the relevant
classification with effect from the date of their engagement or promotion.

Salary on reduction
51.

Where an ongoing employee requests or agrees in writing to perform work at a lower classification
level for a specified period, salary will be determined by the Secretary at a rate applicable to the lower
level for the period specified. The rate will normally be the top of the range of the lower classification.

52.

Where an employee permanently reduces to a lower classification level, by consent or direction
from the Secretary, the Secretary will determine salary within the lower classification level having
regards to the experience, qualifications and skills of the employee. The rate will normally be the
top of the range of the lower classification.

Salary advancement
53.

On 15 July each year, an ongoing employee (excluding employees under the department’s Training
Broadband), who is not already on the maximum salary, will be eligible for salary advancement to
the next pay point in their classification if the employee:
a. has performed duties in the department at that classification level or higher for a period of
three continuous months or more in the performance cycle and
b. has received ratings of ‘Meets Expectations’ for both business deliverables and observable work
behaviours as part of the end cycle performance appraisal ending 30 June each year.

54.

a. was in receipt of continuous TPL at the same classification or higher and salary level from
1 April to 15 July that year and
b. has received ratings of ‘Meets Expectations’ for both business deliverables and observable work
behaviours at the TPL classification as part of the end cycle performance appraisal ending
30 June that year.
Where there is a break in TPL between 30 June and 15 July of the same calendar year the
employee is still eligible for salary advancement at both levels.
An ongoing employee who is promoted or moved within the broadband between 1 April and
15 July each year, and was in receipt of continuous TPL at the same classification and salary level
from 1 April to immediately before the promotion, will be eligible for salary advancement subject to
meeting the requirements in clause 53.

with the FW Act.

Working hours
127. All employees are required to maintain a record of attendance.
128. The ordinary hours for full time employees are 150 hours per settlement period, which equates to
7 hours and 30 minutes per day.
129. The bandwidth is a 12 hour period from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm Monday to Friday, except on a public

a minimum break, the employee will be paid at double the hourly rate for the hours worked, until
they have had an eight hour break plus reasonable travelling time.
134. Where all or some of the employee’s minimum break occurs during ordinary hours, the employee
will not lose pay for the absence.
135. Arrangements for shift workers are contained in Attachment G of the Agreement.

Ordinary hours – Full time employees
136. An employee’s pattern of ordinary hours should be agreed between the employee and their
manager. These ordinary hours may need to be varied on occasions by either the employee or the
manager to accommodate operational or personal requirements.
137. Where agreement cannot be reached on the pattern of ordinary hours, the issue should be raised
with the next level manager. Where agreement cannot be reached on the pattern of ordinary hours,
the employee will work a standard day.

18 |

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

Part time employees
138. The department may engage an employee on a part time basis. An employee engaged on a part time
basis does not have an automatic right to vary their part time hours or access full time hours.
139. A part time employee is an employee whose ordinary hours are less than 150 hours per settlement
period. Employees are required to work at least three continuous hours on any agreed working day.
140. Employees who work part time can agree to work outside their agreed ordinary hours and pattern of
work. In such instances, part time APS employees will be entitled to access flex time provisions, and
EL employees are entitled to access time off in lieu (TOIL), subject to the Executive Level TOIL
provisions located in clauses 164–167. Where work is directed outside an APS employee’s agreed
ordinary hours, overtime rates are applicable.
141. An employee may request access to part time employment at any time. Managers will make every
attempt to accommodate the request having regard to both operational requirements of the
department and the personal needs of the employee.

access to part time employment, upon application, until the child reaches three years of age.
Thereafter, an employee may request flexible working arrangements in accordance with the FW Act.

regard to operational requirements and the employee’s circumstances.

Flex time
144. Flex time is available to all APS level employees. All hours must be recorded on the departmental
flex sheet.
145. Employees accumulate flex time working within the Bandwidth.
146. A flex credit is where an employee accumulates hours in excess of ordinary hours with the agreement
of their manager. An employee may only carry over a maximum of 37.5 hours flex credit into the next
settlement period. In exceptional circumstances and where the manager has expressly agreed to the
additional hours being worked, greater than 37.5 hours may be carried over one settlement period.
147. In exceptional circumstances, People, Communication and Legal Group may:
a. direct the excess flex leave to be taken so that the balance is below 37.5 hours or
b. offer the employee the option to cash out flex time credits in excess of 37.5 hours at an ordinary
time rate or
c. convert the excess credits to annual leave on a one to one basis.
148. A flex debit occurs when the employee works less time than their ordinary hours. An employee may
only accrue a flex debit and carry over a maximum of 15 hours flex debit into the next settlement
period with the agreement of their manager.
149. Flex leave is where an employee works less than their ordinary hours on any given day and is not on
any other form of leave. Flex leave requires prior approval by the employee’s manager, and for
periods of one day or more reasonable notice is required.
150. Where there is insufficient work, a manager may require an employee not to work hours in addition to
their ordinary hours.
151. Where an employee’s manager considers the employee’s attendance is unsatisfactory or that the
employee is misusing flex, the employee may be required to work ordinary hours for a period
specified by the manager.

Overtime
152. Where operational requirements make it necessary, a manager may direct an employee to work
outside and in excess of their ordinary hours on any day.
153. An APS level employee directed to perform work outside and in excess of their ordinary hours on
a given day will be paid overtime, or where agreed, time off in lieu of overtime payment at the
applicable overtime rates.
154. Where a period of overtime is not continuous with ordinary time work, the base period of overtime
payment for such work will be calculated as if the employee had worked for four hours. When
determining whether a period is continuous with ordinary time work, meal breaks should not be
regarded as breaking continuity.
155. Overtime payments approved by an employee’s manager will be calculated as follows:
• Monday to Saturday: one and a half times the hourly rate for the first three hours each day
and double the hourly rate thereafter
• Sunday: double the hourly rate
• Public Holiday: two and a half times the hourly rate (except for duty on a public holiday within
agreed ordinary time work, which will be paid at one and a half time the hourly rate in addition
to normal salary payment for the day).
156. Time off in lieu of overtime payment may be approved by an employee’s manager under certain
circumstances. Where time off in lieu of payment has been agreed and the employee has not been
granted time off within four weeks or another agreed period due to operational requirements,
payment of the original entitlement or the residual entitlement where the full entitlement was not
granted will be made.
157. Executive Level employees will only be eligible to receive overtime payments in exceptional
circumstances with the approval of the Secretary.

Restriction allowance
158. Where an employee is required to remain contactable, available and able to perform extra duty
outside their agreed ordinary hours (i.e. be restricted), they will be paid a restriction allowance,
subject to approval by the Secretary.
159. Restricted employees will receive a restriction allowance at the rate of nine per cent of their
ordinary hourly rate for each hour they are restricted outside the bandwidth, subject to:
a. the employee remaining contactable, fit and available to perform extra duty and
b. the employee not being in receipt of any other payment for the period for which restriction
allowance would otherwise be payable, except as provided for in the following clause.
160. Restriction allowance is payable whether or not the restricted employee is required to perform duty
outside the agreed ordinary hours. Where a restricted employee entitled to overtime payment is
required to perform duty, overtime will be payable and subject to:
a. a one hour base rate of payment when work is performed without the necessity to travel to
the workplace
b. a three hour base rate of payment, including travel time, if work is required to be performed at
the workplace.

20 |

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

161. If an employee is required to perform subsequent periods of duty within the one hour minimum
payment period, only the initial one hour minimum is payable. Where an employee is required to
undertake a second period of duty that commences after the one hour minimum payment period
has lapsed for the first period of duty, a second one hour minimum payment period commences
and a further one hour minimum is payable.
162. Restriction allowance will continue to be paid for periods of overtime worked while restricted.

Emergency duty
163. Emergency duty will attract a base payment of two hours (which includes reasonable travel time) at
double the hourly rate, which will be payable for all emergency duty without prior notice. Executive
Level employees will only be eligible to receive emergency duty payments in exceptional
circumstances with the approval of the Secretary.

Overtime meal allowance
164. Where an employee who is eligible for overtime payment is directed to work overtime for at least
three hours outside their ordinary hours, their manager will approve a flat rate overtime meal
allowance of $26. Where an employee works a further five hours overtime on a Saturday, Sunday
or public holiday, they will receive an additional overtime meal allowance of $26.

Executive Level employees – flexibility and time off in lieu
165. The hours of duty worked by Executive Level employees are not regular and Executive Level
employees may be required to work additional time beyond ordinary hours.
166. Executive Level employees are able to work flexible hours. This means that arrangements for
managing variations in attendance times and short-term absences, including full days, may be
agreed in advance with the manager.
167. Where substantial additional work is required, TOIL is able to be accessed by agreement with the
manager. TOIL will not be on an hour for hour basis or replicate a flex time system.
168. Reasonable requests for time off under these arrangements will not be refused, except for
operational reasons.

Working from home
169. Any employee may request approval to work from home, although arrangements must suit the type
of work performed and operational requirements.

Christmas Closedown
170. All departmental workplaces will be closed from 12:30 pm on the last working day before
Christmas Day and reopen the first working day following the first day of January. This period will
be known as the Christmas Closedown.
171. Employees are not required to attend for duty during the Christmas Closedown, unless otherwise
directed by the Secretary, and will be paid in accordance with their ordinary hours of work. Where
an employee is absent on leave, payment for the Christmas Closedown will be in accordance with
the entitlement for that form of leave (e.g. if on long service leave at half pay, payment is on half
pay). There will be no deduction from annual or personal leave credits for the Christmas Closedown.
172. Where an employee who is eligible for overtime and restriction provisions is directed to attend work
or be available for work during the Christmas Closedown, the overtime rate applicable to Sunday
overtime will apply for the days designated as Christmas Closedown.

Part I – Leave
Portability of leave
173. Where an employee joins the department on an ongoing or non-ongoing basis from an employer
staffed under the PS Act, the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 or from the ACT Government Service,
accrued annual and personal leave (however described) will be transferred or recognised, provided
there is no break in continuity of service, or payments made to the employee in lieu of these
entitlements from the previous employer.
174. Service with organisations where the employee was previously employed under the PS Act, the
Parliamentary Service Act 1999, or from the ACT Government Service may be recognised for
personal leave purposes if the break in service is not more than two calendar months.

Impact of leave without pay on personal and annual leave
175. Where an employee takes 30 or more days leave without pay in total in a calendar year, the whole
period will not count as service for annual and personal leave purposes.
176. Where an employee takes 30 or more days leave without pay (including an accumulated period)
during the calendar year, the whole period will not count as service.

Cancellation of leave or recall to duty from leave
177. Where an employee’s leave is cancelled by their manager without reasonable notice, or they are
recalled to work from leave, reasonable travel costs, travelling time, incidental costs and any other
unavoidable costs arising from the recall to duty will be reimbursed where they are not recoverable
under insurance or from another source. All unused leave will be re-credited.

Re-crediting periods of approved leave
178. An employee who becomes eligible for personal, carers or compassionate leave, or any nondiscretionary leave under the National Employment Standards (NES), while on annual or long
service leave may apply to have their annual or long service leave re-credited. Subject to the
provision of satisfactory evidence, the employee’s annual or long service leave will be re-credited to
the extent of the leave subsequently granted.

Workers’ compensation
179. An employee on workers’ compensation leave under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation
Act 1988, whose compensation is calculated on the basis of actual hours worked, will have their
annual and personal leave accrual calculated in the same way.

annual leave accumulates. Annual leave counts as service for all purposes.
183. An employee may be granted annual leave at half pay. Where an employee takes annual leave at
half pay, the employee cannot access purchased leave in the same calendar year.
184. Employees may request in writing to cash out annual leave so long as the remaining accrued
entitlement to annual leave does not fall below 20 days (pro rata for equivalent part time
employees). The employee will be paid the full amount that would have been paid to the employee
had the employee taken the leave that is cashed out.
185. The Secretary will not approve requests to cash out leave in accordance with this clause unless the
employee has taken at least 10 days annual leave at the same time or has taken a block of 10 days
annual leave (pro rata equivalent for part time employees) in the same calendar year.
186. Employees who have accrued an annual leave credit of 40 days (or equivalent of two years) or more
may be directed by their manager to take at least 10 days annual leave within 12 weeks of the
direction. The manager may agree to extend the period to take leave to six months where extended
leave has been pre-approved and arranged.

manager must grant a period of leave to enable the employee to reduce their leave credits below
40 days (or equivalent of two years).
188. Subject to medical verification of pregnancy, the requirement to reduce annual leave credits below
40 days (or equivalent of two years credit) will not apply during the term of the pregnancy and the
paid maternity and maternal leave. Annual leave credits must be reduced to below 40 days (or
equivalent of two years credit) before the employee returns to work.
189. Periods of long service leave cannot be broken with annual leave, except as provided for by legislation.

of personal leave. This request should be made at the time the leave is notified or within a reasonable
period of time after the leave is notified.

26 |

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

235. The leave granted may be for the period requested or for another period, and to count as service or
not to count as service. Where miscellaneous leave is refused the manager will advise the employee

236. Employees will be granted miscellaneous leave without pay where, due to an increase in their
working hours, they have not accrued the equivalent of four weeks annual leave based on their
current working hours. The maximum amount of leave provided will be the difference between the
amount of leave accrued over the year and 20 days at their current working hours. This will count

unpaid maternity, adoption or long term foster care and permanent care orders leave will count for
service. Unpaid parental leave types will not count as service unless otherwise provided for under
legislation. Unpaid parental leave will not be taken to have broken service.
244. To provide for flexible administration, employees have the option to spread the payment for all paid
parental leave types up to double the number of weeks at a rate of one-half of the normal salary for
the employee. When payment is spread at half pay, only the full pay equivalent period will count as
service (except to the extent this clause contradicts with clause 241).

Part J – Management of excess employees
260. The following provisions apply to all employees covered by this Agreement, excluding an employee
serving a probationary period and a non-ongoing employee.
261. The department will, as far as possible, avoid involuntary redundancies. Reasonable steps will be
taken to facilitate redeployment opportunities at level across the department and the APS for
excess or potentially excess employees.
262. An offer of voluntary redundancy to an employee who is not fit for and not at work may be made to
an employee who is excess in accordance with the paragraph below only where the Secretary,
having regard to the Commonwealth’s liability, decides it is appropriate.

Discussion and consideration period
263. Where an excess employee situation is identified, the Secretary will:
a. advise the employee(s) directly affected of the situation, the reasons and scope and invite the
employee(s) to nominate a representative
b. discuss the voluntary redundancy and reassignment processes with affected employees
c. hold discussions with the employee(s) and their nominated representatives and
d. offer the affected employee(s) voluntary redundancy.
264. The employee(s) will have two months in which to consider the offer of voluntary redundancy.
An employee who has received an offer of voluntary redundancy must advise the Secretary, in
writing, before the end of the discussion and consideration period whether they wish to be
considered for re-assignment or voluntary redundancy.
265. Employees will become excess one month after being made an offer of voluntary redundancy,
unless during this time their employment has been terminated, they have been redeployed or the
Secretary decides they are no longer in an excess situation.
266. If the employee does not respond, the employee will be taken to have a preference to be
considered for reassignment, and their retention period will commence in accordance with
clause 286.

Voluntary redundancy offer
267. The offer must state when the Secretary proposes to issue the termination notice if the offer
is accepted.
268. The offer should include the following information to assist the employee in their considerations:
• amount payable as redundancy pay, pay in lieu of notice and accrued annual and long service
leave credits
• superannuation entitlements upon voluntary redundancy
• superannuation options
• taxation rules applicable to the various payments
• the availability of financial assistance, on a reimbursement basis, towards obtaining
independent financial advice up to the value of $1,200.
269. Should the employee request and receive an earlier termination date that falls within the discussion
and consideration period, the employee will be entitled to receive payment for the unexpired
portion of the discussion and consideration period.

30 |

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

Career transition assistance
270. At the time the employee is offered a voluntary redundancy or as soon as possible thereafter but
no later than two weeks after the voluntary redundancy offer, potentially excess employee(s) will be
offered career transition assistance which will include:
a.
b.
c.
d.

advice on the re-assignment and redundancy process
a point of contact for individual queries
assistance with identifying re-assignment opportunities and/or
training/redeployment assistance.

271. Employees may also access the department’s Employee Assistance Program for free
personal counselling.

Voluntary redundancy process
272. If an employee accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy, and the Secretary agrees to the
redundancy, the Secretary will issue a ‘notice of termination’ under section 29 of the PS Act.
273. The period of notice will be four weeks, or five weeks for an employee over 45 years of age with at
least five years of continuous, current APS service at the time of the offer. Where an employee
elects to terminate their employment before the expiration of the notice period, payment in lieu for
the unexpired portion of the notice period will be made.
274. Notice of termination will not be given before the end of the discussion and consideration period
without the agreement of the employee.
275. Only one offer of voluntary redundancy will be made to an employee.
276. Job exchanges will be available until the end of the discussion and consideration periods. A job
exchange is where a departmental employee who has been offered voluntary redundancy but does
not want one, swaps jobs with an employee from within the Department or from another agency
who is not excess but who wants voluntary redundancy. Job exchanges are subject to the
Secretary’s approval on a case by case basis.
277. An employee will not be made involuntarily redundant if the employee has not been offered
a voluntary redundancy, or has requested, but not received an offer of voluntary redundancy.

Severance pay
278. An employee who accepts voluntary redundancy and whose employment is terminated under
section 29 of the PS Act on the grounds that they are excess to requirements will be entitled to the
following severance pay, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the
NES:
a. two weeks of salary for each completed continuous year of service and
b. a pro rata payment for completed continuous months of service since the last completed year
of service.
279. The minimum amount of severance pay is an amount equal to four weeks’ salary and the maximum
amount payable is an amount equal to 48 weeks’ salary.
280. Severance pay is calculated on a pro rata basis for any period of service when the employee
worked part time, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the NES.

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

|

31

281. For an excess employee, salary includes:
a. the employee’s substantive salary on the date of termination and
b. temporary performance loading where the employee has received the loading for a continuous
period of at least 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the employee is given
a formal offer of a voluntary redundancy and
c. allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of annual leave and on
a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement for expenses incurred,
or a payment for disabilities associated with the performance of duty.

Service for severance pay purposes
282. Service for severance pay purposes means:
a. service in the department
b. Government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth
Employees) Act 1976
c. service with a Commonwealth body (other than service with a Joint Commonwealth-State body
corporate in which the Commonwealth does not have a controlling interest) which is recognised
for long service leave purposes
d. service with the Australian Defence Forces
e. APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under repealed section 49 of the Public
Service Act 1922, if the service has not previously been recognised for severance pay purposes
f. service in another organisation where an employee was transferred from that organisation with
a transfer of function; or an employee engaged by that organisation on work within a function is
appointed as a result of the transfer of that function to the APS and such service is recognised
for long service leave purposes.
283. For earlier periods of service to count, there must be no breaks between the periods of service,
except where:
a. the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of employment with the
new employer was made and accepted by the employee before ceasing employment with
the preceding employer or
b. the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee was deemed
to have resigned from the APS under the repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922.

Service not to count for severance pay purposes
284. Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes are previous periods
of service that ceased by way of:
a. termination under section 29 of the PS Act or
b. prior to the commencement of the PS Act, by way of redundancy; forfeiture of office, retirement
on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or loss of qualifications; dismissal or termination of
probationary appointment for reasons of unsatisfactory service or
c. voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the employee or
d. payment of a redundancy benefit or a similar payment or an employer-financed retirement benefit.

32 |

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

285. Absences from duty which do not count as service for long service leave purposes will not count for
severance pay purposes.

Retention period
286. Should an employee not accept the formal offer of voluntary redundancy, the employee will
commence their retention period one month after the offer of voluntary redundancy. The notice
period will be concurrent with the retention period.
287. The purpose of the retention period is to enable excess employees to be reassigned within the APS
or to find other suitable employment. Consistent with this, during the retention period:
a. the department will continue to provide and resource reasonable career transition services and
support, and take all reasonable steps to move an excess employee to a suitable vacancy, to
another agency or to pursue placements outside the APS consistent with this Agreement and
b. employees will take all reasonable steps to secure permanent re-assignment or placement.
288. The retention period is:
a. 13 months where an employee has 20 or more years of continuous, current service with the
APS or is over 45 years of age
b. seven months for other employees.
289. If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, their retention period is
reduced by the employee’s redundancy pay entitlement under the NES on termination, calculated
as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this clause).

Redeployment
290. The following provisions will apply to employees during their retention period:
a. The employee can access up to $1,200 for payment for outplacement services or training
opportunities that would be expected to enhance the employment prospects of employees.
b. Excess employees of the department will be considered first and in isolation from, and not in
competition with, other applicants who are not excess for an advertised vacancy to which the
employee seeks transfer but only at or below the employee’s level. In placing excess employees,
consideration will be given to the employee’s current skills and experience or the employee’s
ability to acquire the relevant skills for the advertised vacancy in a short period of time.
c. Suitable trial placements in other organisations, including private sector organisations, will be
funded for up to three months where there is an identifiable opportunity for permanent
placement and no job swap arrangement is involved. An individual employee may undertake
more than one trial placement.
d. The employee will be entitled to reasonable paid leave for the purpose of attending
employment interviews and may request assistance in meeting reasonable travel costs and
incidental expenses incurred by the employee in seeking alternative employment, where these
are not met by the prospective employer.
e. The employee may, after being given four weeks of notice, be reduced in classification as
a means of securing alternative employment. If reduction occurs after the offer of voluntary
redundancy and before the end of the retention period the employee will receive payments to
maintain the employee’s salary level for the balance of the retention period.

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

|

33

Extension of the retention period
291. Retention periods will only be extended by periods of approved leave due to the employee’s illness
or injury (supported by medical evidence) taken during the retention period. The period will not be
extended on these grounds beyond an additional eight weeks.

Involuntary redundancy
292. If an excess employee is unsuccessful in obtaining permanent reassignment at the end of the
retention period, the employee’s employment will be terminated under section 29 of the PS Act.
An employee may be entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES.
293. Where an excess employee’s employment is to be terminated the employee will be given four
weeks’ notice of termination (or five weeks for an employee over 45 years of age with at least five
years of continuous, current APS service). This period of notice will be served, as far as practicable,
concurrently with the retention period.

34 |

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

Part K – Separation
Resignation
294. An employee, where practicable, is requested to give the Secretary at least two weeks’ notice in
writing of their intention to resign or retire. Where an employee submits a resignation which takes
effect on a public holiday, the resignation will be deemed effective from close of business on the
working day immediately prior to the public holiday. All resignations will be deemed to take effect
at close of business of the resignation date.
295. Any outstanding payments for purchased leave or any flex debt will be deducted from a person’s
final monies if they cease to work for the department.

Payment on death
296. Where an employee dies, or the Secretary directs that an employee will be presumed to have died
on a particular date, the Secretary may authorise the payment of an amount that would have been
paid if the employee had otherwise ceased employment either by resignation or age retirement on
that day.
297. Payment will be made to dependants or the partner of the former employee or the former
employee’s legal personal representative.

Department of Education and Training Enterprise Agreement 2016–2019

35

Part L – Dispute resolution
298. These provisions set out the procedures to settle disputes relating to:
a. a matter arising under this Agreement or
b. the NES.
299. An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the purposes of the
procedures of these provisions.
300. In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the workplace level,
by discussions between the employee or employees and the relevant supervisors and/or
management.
301. If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may refer the
matter to the Fair Work Commission (FWC).
302. The FWC may deal with the dispute in two stages:
a. the FWC will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers appropriate, including by
mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a recommendation and
b. if the FWC is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, the FWC may then:
• arbitrate the dispute and
• make a determination that is binding on the parties.
Note: If the FWC arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available to it under the
FW Act. A decision that the FWC makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for the purpose of
Div 3 of Part 5.1 of the FW Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made against the decision.
303. While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this term:
a. an employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally unless they have a
reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety
b. an employee must comply with a direction given by the Secretary to perform other available
work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
• the work is not safe or
• applicable work health and safety legislation would not permit the work to be performed or
• the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform or
• there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply with the direction.
304. The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the FWC in accordance with
these provisions.
