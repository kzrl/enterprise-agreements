Performance Assessment Cycle for the financial year that has just been
completed.

83.

pay point for their classification in accordance with clause 82 of this Agreement.

Salary advancement and temporary performance of duties at a higher classification
84.

An Employee who temporarily performs duties at a higher classification from 1 April or
earlier, to at least 15 August, will be eligible for salary advancement at both the higher and

the Employee demonstrates an ability to undertake work satisfactorily at the
higher classification, and, if appropriate, has the necessary qualification, skills
and/or experience, or

Page 17 of 53

the Employee is successful in an open merit selection process consistent with
the Public Service Act.
Government Lawyer advancement provisions
88.

An Employee who is paid under the Government Lawyer Broadband and who satisfies the
advancement requirements in clause 87 may advance up to a maximum of three
incremental pay points.

89.

Advancement through the Government Lawyer Broadband is also subject to the following
requirements:
the Employee demonstrates an ability to undertake work satisfactorily at the
higher classification
if the Employee is being advanced to the second pay point in the Government
Lawyer Broadband (APS4), the Chief Executive Officer is satisfied that the
Employee has been admitted as a solicitor of the High Court of Australia or the
Supreme Court of a State or Territory, and
if the Employee is being advanced to the Senior Government Lawyer
classification the Employee has been performing the work of the type and
complexity required of a Senior Government Lawyer for at least three
consecutive months.

90.

Employees who advance to the Senior Government Lawyer classification will only advance
to the lowest pay point unless they have previously performed higher duties at the Senior
Government Lawyer classification for 12 or more months prior to advancement. Employees
who have not previously performed higher duties at the Senior Government Lawyer
classification for 12 or more months must remain at the lowest pay point for least 12 months
before being entitled to further advancement in the Government Lawyer Broadband.

91.

Where the Chief Executive Officer determines that there is more than one Employee at a
Government Lawyer classification who is capable of performing work at the Senior
Government Lawyer classification but there is insufficient work available at the higher
classification for all such Employees, a merit selection exercise should be conducted to
determine which Employee or Employees will be advanced to the Senior Government
Lawyer classification.

Higher duties and Temporary Performance Loading (TPL)
92.

Employees who are temporarily performing duties at a higher classification for three
continuous weeks or more are entitled to receive TPL.

93.

Where TPL is payable, it is paid at the lowest pay point of the higher classification unless
the Chief Executive Officer determines otherwise and is paid from the first day of the
commencement of the higher duties.

94.

If the higher duties is for the minimum period that would attract TPL and a decision is made
to share the opportunity between Employees, each Employee will be paid TPL for the
period they perform duties at the higher classification.

95.

Where an Employee is temporarily assigned duties at a classification in the Senior
Executive Service, TPL will be determined by the Chief Executive Officer.
Page 18 of 53

96.

Where an Employee is absent on paid leave, or observes a Public Holiday, during a period
the Employee was temporarily assigned duties at a higher classification, TPL will be
payable for that absence, to the extent of the continued operation of the assignment. Where
the period of leave is at half pay, the rate of TPL will be adjusted to half.

Superannuation
97.

The Agency will make compulsory employer contributions as required by legislation and
fund requirements.

98.

The Agency’s default superannuation fund is the Public Sector Superannuation
Accumulation Plan. The Agency will provide employer superannuation contributions to
members of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan of no less than 15.4 per
cent of an Employee’s fortnightly contribution salary.

99.

Where an Employee has chosen an accumulation superannuation fund other than the
Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the employer contribution will be the
same percentage as required for Employees who are members of Public Sector
Superannuation Accumulation Plan. This will not be reduced by any other contributions
made through salary sacrifice arrangements. This clause does not apply where a
superannuation fund cannot accept employer contributions (for example, it is unable to
accept contributions for people aged over 75).

100.

For chosen funds, the Agency will pay superannuation contributions to accumulation
superannuation funds during periods of paid and unpaid parental leave (including Maternity,
Parental, Adoption and Foster Care Leave). Contributions for periods of paid leave are not
limited. Contributions for periods of unpaid leave are up to a maximum of 52 weeks unless
otherwise required by legislation or fund requirements.

101.

The Chief Executive Officer may decide to limit choice of an alternative superannuation fund
to complying superannuation funds that allow employee and/or employer contributions to be
paid through fortnightly electronic funds transfer using a file generated by the payroll system
used by the Agency.

102.

Any fees applied by a chosen fund associated with the administration of superannuation
contributions will be borne by the Employee.

Allowances

103.

Ongoing Employees who are appointed or elected to a workplace responsibility role are
entitled to a Workplace Responsibility Allowance. The following Workplace Responsibility

Salary packaging
113.

Employees are entitled to access flexible salary packaging. Where an Employee takes up
the option of flexible salary packaging on a ‘salary sacrifice’ basis, the Employee’s salary for
purposes of superannuation, severance and termination payments (and any other purpose)
will be determined as if the flexible salary packaging arrangement had not been entered
into.

114.

Any fringe benefits tax incurred in relation to an Employee as a result of their salary
packaging arrangement will be met by the individual Employee.

115.

For more information, refer to the Safe Work Australia Salary Packaging Policy.

Page 20 of 53

Overpayments
116.

Where an Employee is overpaid an amount of salary or other benefits, the overpayment will
be recovered in accordance with the Fair Work Act and the Agency's Accountable Authority
Instructions.

Page 21 of 53

PART D - WORK LIFE BALANCE
Hours of work and attendance
117.

An Employee must work their Ordinary Hours, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Chief Executive Officer.

118.

Ordinary Hours may be averaged over the Settlement Period for the purpose of determining
flex debit/credit carry over, with the agreement of the Employee’s manager.

119.

An Employee must not work more than five hours without an unpaid meal break of at least
thirty minutes.

120.

An Employee must not work more than ten hours per day unless directed to do so by the
Chief Executive Officer. The calculation of ten hours does not include travel time.

Unapproved absences
121.

Where an Employee is absent from duty without approval, the Employee is not entitled to
remuneration, including salary, and other benefits under this Agreement. An unapproved
absence will not count as service for any purpose.

122.

Amounts paid to an Employee in respect of an unapproved absence are overpayments and
the Agency will recover those amounts in accordance with the Fair Work Act and the
Agency's Accountable Authority Instructions.

Rest break
123.

Employees should not commence work on any day without having at least a minimum eight
hour break, plus reasonable travelling time, from the previous day’s work.

124.

Where the Chief Executive Officer requires an Employee to resume or continue work
without having had a minimum break, the Employee will be paid at double the hourly rate for
the hours worked, until they have had an eight hour continuous break.

125.

Where all or some of the Employee’s minimum break occurs during their Ordinary Hours,
the Employee will be considered to have worked during this time and the Employee will not
lose pay for the absence.

Flex Time
126.

Flex Time is available to all Employees engaged at or below the APS 6 classification.

127.

Eligible Employees may accumulate Flex Time within the Bandwidth. All Employees
engaged at or below the APS 6 classification must record their hours of work daily on
commencing and ceasing work in the manner stipulated by the Agency.

128.

A flex credit occurs where an eligible Employee accumulates hours in excess of their
Ordinary Hours. For a Full-time Employee, a maximum of 37 hours and 30 minutes flex
credit may be accumulated and carried over into the next Settlement Period. For a Part-time
Employee, a maximum flex credit that is equal to their weekly Ordinary Hours may be
accumulated and carried over to the next Settlement Period.

Page 22 of 53

129.

A flex debit occurs where an eligible Employee works less time than their Ordinary Hours.
For a Full-time Employee, a maximum of 22 hours and 30 minutes flex debit can be
accumulated and carried over to the next Settlement Period. For a Part-time Employee, a
maximum flex debit that is equivalent to 60 per cent of their weekly Ordinary Hours can be
accumulated and carried over to the next Settlement Period.

130.

Any flex debit will be deducted from a person’s final monies if they cease to work for the
Agency in accordance with the Fair Work Act and the Agency's Accountable Authority
Instructions.

131.

Flex leave is where an eligible Employee is absent with their manager’s approval on any
given day or part day and is not on any other form of leave. A Full-time Employee may use
up to the equivalent of five days flex leave or incur up to three days flex debit in a
Settlement Period (pro-rata for Part-time Employees). Flex leave requires prior approval
from the Employee's manager, and reasonable notice is required.

132.

Where there is insufficient work, the Chief Executive Officer may direct an Employee not to
work time in addition to their Ordinary Hours.

133.

Where the Chief Executive Officer considers that the Employee's attendance is
unsatisfactory or that the Employee is misusing Flex Time, the Chief Executive Officer may
direct the Employee to work Ordinary Hours for a period of time specified by the Chief
Executive Officer.

Executive Level Employees – flexible working arrangements
134.

An Executive Level Employee may work flexible hours where their manager agrees.

135.

Executive Level Employees are expected to work reasonable additional hours, and their
salary takes this into account.

136.

Executive Level Employees may access Time Off in Lieu (TOIL). TOIL is where an
Executive Level Employee is absent with their manager’s approval on any given day or part
day but is not on any other form of leave. TOIL does not accumulate on an hour-for-hour
basis. TOIL may be taken in conjunction with approved leave. A formal application need not
be completed.

Overtime
137.

Where operational requirements make it necessary, the Chief Executive Officer may direct
an Employee to work outside the Standard Day or in excess of their Ordinary Hours on any
given day.

138.

An Employee directed to work outside the Standard Day or in excess of their Ordinary
Hours on any given day is entitled to overtime payment, or where agreed, equivalent Flex
Time. If the Employee receives payment of overtime in their salary, this is instead of, not in
addition to, an accrual of flex credits for the purposes of Flex Time.

139.

Where a period of overtime is not continuous with the Employee's Ordinary Hours, not
including Emergency Duty, the base period of overtime payment for such work will be
calculated as if the Employee had worked for four hours. When determining whether a
period is continuous with Ordinary Hours, meal breaks should not be regarded as breaking
continuity.

Page 23 of 53

140.

141.

Overtime payments will be calculated as follows:


Monday to Saturday: one and a half times the Employee’s hourly rate for the first
three hours each day and double the hourly rate thereafter.



Sunday: double the Employee’s hourly rate.



Public Holiday: two and a half times the Employee’s hourly rate.

For Employees at or below the APS 6 classification, agreed Flex Time in lieu of overtime
may be taken as follows:
Combination - where the Employee and the Chief Executive Officer agree, Flex
Time on an “hour for hour” basis with an entitlement to a residual payment (for
example - three hours' time off plus three hours pay at half the Employees’
hourly rate, instead of three hours overtime at time and a half); or
Flex Time only - on an overtime rate basis (for example, four and a half hours'
Flex Time instead of three hours overtime payment at time and a half).

142.

Where Flex Time has been agreed instead of overtime payment and the Employee has not
been granted flex leave in four weeks or another agreed period, due to operational
requirements, payment of the overtime entitlement will be made.

143.

Executive Level Employees will only be entitled to receive overtime in special
circumstances and with the approval of the Chief Executive Officer. The Employee may be
compensated for additional hours worked in the form of TOIL but there is no entitlement to
compensation on an hour-for-hour basis.

Overtime Meal Allowance
144.

Where an Employee at or below the APS 6 classification is directed to work at least three
hours outside the Standard Day or in excess of their Ordinary Hours they will receive a meal
allowance of $27.50. Where such an Employee works a further five hours on a Saturday,
Sunday or Public Holiday, they will receive an additional meal allowance of $27.50.
Overtime Meal Allowance is payable regardless of whether the directed overtime is
compensated as paid overtime or as Flex Time at overtime rates.

145.

Where special circumstances exist and an Executive Level Employee is entitled to paid
overtime, they may also receive a meal allowance of $27.50 but only where they have been
directed to work at least three continuous additional hours outside their Ordinary Hours.
Where an Executive Level Employee is supervising Employees on overtime who are
entitled to the payment of a meal allowance, the Executive Level Employee will also be
entitled to the payment of a meal allowance.

Working from home or another location
146.

The Chief Executive Officer may approve an Employee working from home or another
location.

147.

Where an Employee has a regular approved working from home arrangement, assistance
to maintain home based IT equipment and internet access may be approved by the Chief
Executive Officer, up to a maximum value of $3,000 per annum.

Page 24 of 53

Workplace Health and Wellbeing
148.

The Agency will have a Health and Wellbeing Strategy.

Emergency duty and additional childcare costs
149.

The Chief Executive Officer may direct an Employee who has worked their Ordinary Hours
and ceased duty on a given day to return to duty. This is known as Emergency Duty.

150.

An Employee engaged at or below the APS 6 classification who undertakes Emergency
Duty and who has not received overtime under clause 139 or 140, will be entitled to a base
payment of two hours (which includes reasonable travel time) at double the hourly rate. An
Executive Level Employee who undertakes Emergency Duty will be entitled to a base
payment of two hours (which includes reasonable travel time) at double the hourly rate in
special circumstances with the approval of the Chief Executive Officer.

151.

Employees who undertake Emergency Duty are also entitled to reimbursement for child
care costs where those costs are incurred as a necessary consequence of undertaking
Emergency Duty and could not reasonably have been avoided by the Employee.

Christmas Closedown
152.

The Agency will close its normal operations from 12:30 pm on the last working day before
Christmas Day with operations resuming on the first working day following the first day of
January; this is Christmas Closedown.

153.

An Employee is not required to work during Christmas Closedown, unless directed
otherwise by the Chief Executive Officer.

154.

Payment for absences on working days during Christmas Closedown will be made in
accordance with Employees’ Ordinary Hours, unless the Employee is absent on Long
Service Leave or Maternity Leave. In that case, payment for Christmas Closedown will be in
accordance with the entitlement, if any, for that form of leave

155.

With the exception of Long Service Leave and Maternity Leave, there will be no deduction
from leave credits during Christmas Closedown.

156.

If an Employee is directed by the Chief Executive Officer to work during Christmas
Closedown, they will entitled to overtime, or where agreed, equivalent Flex Time for those
working hours, or if they are an Executive Level Employee, TOIL on an hour-for-hour basis.

157.

An absence during Christmas Closedown by an Employee who would normally be working
their Ordinary Hours will count as service for all purposes.

Public Holidays
158.

Employees are entitled to the following Public Holidays:
New Year's Day (1 January)
Australia Day (26 January)
Good Friday

Page 25 of 53

Easter Monday
Anzac Day (25 April)
The Queen's Birthday holiday (on the day which it is celebrated in a State or
Territory or region of a State or Territory)
Christmas Day (25 December)
Boxing Day (26 December), and
Any other day, or part-day, declared or prescribed by or under a law of a State
or Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a region of
the State or Territory, as a Public Holiday, other than a day, or part-day, or a
kind of day or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work Regulations as
counting as a Public Holiday.
159.

If under a law of a State or Territory, a day or part-day is substituted for one of the Public
Holidays in clause 158, then the substituted day or part-day is the Public Holiday.

160.

The Chief Executive Officer and an Employee may agree on a substitution of a day or partday that would otherwise be a Public Holiday, having regard to operational requirements.

161.

An Employee, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a Public Holiday in the place where
the Employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid for the day or part-day
absence as if that day or part-day was not a public holiday, except where that person would
not normally have worked that day.

162.

Where a Public Holiday falls during a period when an Employee is absent on leave (other
than Annual Leave or paid Personal/Carer's Leave), there is no entitlement to receive
payment as a Public Holiday. Payment for that day would be in accordance with the
entitlement for that form of leave.

Page 26 of 53

PART E - TRAVEL
163.

An Employee must have prior approval from the Chief Executive Officer to undertake travel
for official business and to commit expenditure in relation to that travel.

164.

For more information, refer to the Safe Work Australia Travel Policy.

Recognition of travel time
165.

An Employee travelling for official business is entitled to have travel time recognised as
Ordinary Hours.

166.

The Chief Executive Officer may approve the adjustment of the Bandwidth to another 12
hour period for the purposes of recognising travel time as Ordinary Hours (e.g. 5:00 am –
5:00 pm). For the purposes of this Part, Bandwidth means the Bandwidth in Appendix A or
another Bandwidth approved by the Chief Executive Officer under this clause.

167.

For Employees at or below the APS 6 classification, travel for official business undertaken
during the Bandwidth may be recorded as Flex Time, subject to any directions from the
Chief Executive Officer as to how travel time is recorded.

168.

Travel time will not be paid as overtime.

Part day travel allowance
169.

Where an Employee is required to travel for official business for a period of 10 hours or

locality for a period of at least 21 days, the Chief Executive Officer may determine an
alternative living away from home allowance that is reasonable in the circumstances. Trips
home will not be regarded as a break for the purposes of determining whether an Employee
is residing in one locality for a period of at least 21 days.

Page 28 of 53

PART F - LEAVE
Annual Leave
175.

A Full-time Employee is entitled to four weeks’ paid Annual Leave for each year of service.

176.

Annual Leave accrues progressively during a year of service according to the Employee's
Ordinary Hours, and accumulates from year to year.

177.

Annual Leave may be taken at full or half pay. Annual Leave including at half pay counts as
service for all purposes. Where an Employee takes leave at half pay, deductions from leave
credits will also be halved for the duration of the leave.

178.

Annual Leave may be accessed at any time, subject to operational requirements and the
approval of the Employee’s manager.

179.

The Chief Executive Officer may direct an Employee to take Annual Leave where the
direction is reasonable. This would generally include where the Employee has an excessive
Annual Leave balance and has no upcoming leave which will reduce that balance. An
excessive Annual Leave balance means the equivalent of two or more years of leave
accrual.

Cashing Out of Annual Leave
180.

An Employee may request to cash out Annual Leave. The Chief Executive Officer may
approve requests to cash out Annual Leave subject to the following conditions:
Annual Leave must not be cashed out if the cashing out would result in the
Employee's remaining Annual Leave balance being less than four weeks,
each cashing out of Annual Leave must be by a separate agreement in writing
between the Agency and the Employee, and
the Employee must be paid at least the full amount that would have been
payable to the Employee had the Employee taken the leave that the Employee
has forgone.

181.

The Chief Executive Officer will not approve requests to cash out Annual Leave in
accordance with clause 180 unless the Employee takes at least ten days Annual Leave at
the same time or has taken a block of ten days Annual Leave (pro rata for Part-time
Employees) in the same calendar year.

Purchased Leave
182.

With the approval of the Chief Executive Officer, an Employee may purchase up to eight
weeks additional Annual Leave per calendar year or up to twelve weeks additional Annual
Leave for sabbatical purposes. This is known as Purchased Leave.

An Employee who purchases additional Annual leave will have an amount deducted from
their fortnightly salary in equal instalments over the course of a nominated 12 month period
or a lesser period if agreed between the Employee and the Chief Executive Officer.

Page 29 of 53

184.

Unless otherwise agreed, the amount deducted for Purchased Leave not taken during the
nominated 12 month period will automatically be reimbursed at the rate at which it was
purchased.

185.

Where an Employee who has taken Purchased Leave leaves the Agency before having
repaid the Purchase Leave amount in full, the amount outstanding must be repaid before
the Employee’s last day of employment.

186.

Any amounts deducted from an Employee’s salary for Purchased Leave that has not been
taken will be refunded to the Employee on separation.

187.

Purchased Leave can not be taken at half pay.

188.

An Employee who accesses Purchased Leave cannot take Annual Leave at half pay in the
same calendar year.

189.

Purchased Leave counts as service for all purposes.

Personal/Carer's Leave
190.

Full-time ongoing Employees are entitled to 18 days of paid Personal/Carer's Leave per
year of service, credited on 1 January each year.

191.

An ongoing Employee who commences after 1 January will be credited their paid
Personal/Carer’s leave entitlement on commencement. On 1 January in the following year,
the Employee will be credited with a pro-rata amount of paid Personal/Carer’s leave
equivalent to their length of service in the Agency in their commencement year.

192.

Non-ongoing Employees are entitled to:
seven days paid Personal/Carer's Leave on commencement, provided their
prior service has not been recognised, then
accrue paid Personal/Carer's Leave progressively throughout their first year of
service, up to a maximum of 18 days (including the initial seven days), then
be credited 18 days Personal/Carers leave after each 12 months' of service.

193.

Unused paid Personal/Carer's Leave accrues during the course of the Employee’s
employment but is not paid out on separation.

194.

Paid Personal/Carer's Leave counts as service for all purposes and may be taken when an
Employee is absent:
due to personal illness or injury including attendance at Medical Appointments
to provide care or support for a member of the Employee’s Family or household
who is ill or injured, including attendance at Medical Appointments
to provide care or support for a member of the Employee's Family or household
who is affected by an unexpected emergency or special circumstance, or
as a result of special circumstances as approved by the Chief Executive Officer.

Page 30 of 53

195.

Paid Personal/Carer's Leave must not be taken for an absence outlined in clause 194(d) if
this results in the Employee having access to less than the minimum 10 days per year for
Personal/Carer’s Leave purposes under the National Employment Standards.

196.

An Employee receiving workers’ compensation for more than 45 weeks will accrue
Personal/Carer's Leave on the basis of actual hours worked.

197.

Where special circumstances exist, an Employee may take paid Personal/Carer's Leave at
half pay instead of full pay when approved by the Chief Executive Officer. Where an
Employee takes leave at half pay, deductions from leave credits will also be halved for the
duration of the leave.

198.

Where an Employee, including a Casual Employee, has exhausted their paid
Personal/Carer's Leave entitlements they may take two days unpaid leave for each
occasion where a member of their Family or household requires care or support because of
a illness or a injury, or an unexpected emergency or special circumstance affecting the
member.

Notice and evidence required for taking Personal/Carer's Leave
199.

A manager may request an Employee to provide evidence to be entitled to Personal/Carer's
Leave where the Employee is absent from work for a period of one or more days. The
Employee should give notice as soon as practicable of the period or expected period of
leave.

200.

No more than three consecutive days of Personal/Carer’s Leave may be taken without
evidence.

201.

An Employee who does not provide evidence on request may not be entitled to
Personal/Carer's Leave for that absence.

202.

Evidence for taking Personal/Carer's Leave means:
a medical certificate from a health practitioner
a statutory declaration, if it was not reasonably practicable for the Employee to
obtain a medical certificate, and/or
with the prior agreement or direction of the Chief Executive Officer, another form
of evidence, including no evidence.

203.

If an Employee provides a statutory declaration as evidence, the statutory declaration must
set out why the Employee is or was unable to attend work, and why it was not practicable
for them to obtain a medical certificate.

Compassionate Leave
204.

An Employee is entitled to a period of three days of paid Compassionate Leave for each
occasion when a member of the Employee’s Family or household:
contracts or develops a personal illness or sustains a personal injury that poses
a serious threat to their life, or
dies.
Page 31 of 53

205.

Casual Employees engaged by the Agency are entitled to three days unpaid
Compassionate Leave for each occasion outlined in clause 204.

206.

Compassionate Leave does not need to be taken in a single block.

207.

An Employee may be required to provide reasonable evidence to the Chief Executive

who is affected by an unexpected emergency as a result of domestic or family
violence, or
as a result of other pressing or unavoidable absences connected with the health
or wellbeing of the Employee or a member of the Employee's Family or
household as a result of domestic or family violence.

210.

Where an Employee affected by family and domestic violence requires leave for purposes
not covered by clause 209 or where an Employee has exhausted their Personal/Carer's
Leave entitlements, the Chief Executive Officer may determine an alternative leave type,
including Miscellaneous Leave.

211.

Long Service Leave
212.

An Employee will be entitled to Long Service Leave as provided for in the Long Service
Leave Act.

unless otherwise required by legislation, and
the Employee’s next accrual of Annual Leave and paid Personal/Carer’s Leave
will be deferred by one day for each day’s absence inclusive of the initial 30
days. This means that the Employee will not accrue Annual Leave and paid
Personal/Carer’s Leave for the days the Employee is absent.
Cancellation of leave and recall to duty from leave
250.

Where an Employee’s leave is cancelled by the Chief Executive Officer without reasonable
notice, or they are recalled to work from leave:

261.

All resignations will be deemed to take effect at the close of business on the day the
Employee’s notice states will be their last day of work (resignation date). Where an

the Employee is part of a class of Employees that is larger in size than is
necessary for the efficient and economical working of the Agency
the services of an Employee cannot be effectively used because of
technological or other changes in the work methods of the Agency, or structural
or other changes in the nature, extent or organisation of the functions of the
Agency, or
the duties usually performed by the Employee are to be performed in a different
locality, the Employee is not willing to perform the duties at the other locality and
the Chief Executive Officer has determined that these provisions will apply to
that Employee.

Page 38 of 53

Voluntary redundancy
266.

Where the Chief Executive Officer identifies that an Employee is potentially excess, the
Chief Executive Officer will:
advise, in writing, the affected Employee of the situation, including the reasons
for the situation, and
hold discussions with the Employee and their representative (if the Employee
chooses), about the voluntary redundancy and reassignment process, and invite
the Employee to express an interest in a voluntary redundancy.

267.

Where the Employee expresses an interest in a voluntary redundancy, the Employee will be
provided with voluntary redundancy information that includes:
when the Chief Executive Officer proposes to terminate the Employee’s
employment, under section 29 of the Public Service Act
amounts payable as severance pay, pay in lieu of notice and accrued Annual
Leave and Long Service Leave credits
information about superannuation (including amounts of accumulated
superannuation contributions where available)
the taxation rules applicable to the various payments, and
the availability of financial assistance, on a reimbursement basis, towards
obtaining independent financial advice up to the value of $1,200.

268.

The voluntary redundancy information is provided for guidance purposes only, and is not an
offer capable of forming a binding contract.

269.

Only one invitation to express interest in a voluntary redundancy will be provided to an
Employee in a potentially excess situation.

Consideration Period
270.

The Employee will have two months to consider the voluntary redundancy from the date the
Chief Executive Officer provides the Employee with the voluntary redundancy information.
This period is known as the consideration period.

271.

The Employee must advise the Chief Executive Officer, in writing, by the end of the
consideration period whether they wish to be considered for voluntary redundancy or if they
wish to be considered for reassignment of duties.

272.

The Employee may agree in writing to reduce the consideration period by agreeing to an
earlier termination of employment date. Where this occurs, the Employee will receive a
payment for the remainder of the consideration period. The payment is in lieu of any
remainder of the consideration period and will also include an amount equivalent to the
Annual Leave and Long Service Leave entitlements that would have been accrued by the
Employee had they been employed throughout the entire consideration period.

273.

If the Employee neither accepts the voluntary redundancy, nor expresses a preference for
reassignment of duties by the end of the consideration period, it will be taken that the
Page 39 of 53

Employee’s preference is to be considered for reassignment of duties and their retention
period will commence in accordance with clause 286.
Career Transition Assistance
274.

Within one month of being offered a voluntary redundancy, the Employee will be offered
Career Transition Assistance which will include:
advice on the re-assignment and redundancy process
a point of contact for individual queries
assistance with identifying re-assignment opportunities, and
training/redeployment assistance.

Notice of termination of employment
275.

Where an Employee advises that they wish to be considered for a voluntary redundancy,
the Chief Executive Officer may determine that the Employee is excess and terminate the
Employee’s employment under section 29 of the Public Service Act. Termination of
employment will not take effect before the end of the consideration period without the
written agreement of the Employee.

276.

The notice of termination period will be four weeks, or five weeks for an Employee over
45 years of age with at least five years of continuous APS service at the time of the
voluntary redundancy. Where an Employee agrees to an earlier termination of employment
date before the end of the consideration period, the Employee will be entitled to receive
payment in lieu of the entire notice of termination period. Where an Employee agrees to an
earlier termination after the end of the consideration period, the Employee will be entitled to
receive payment for any unserved portion of the notice of termination period.

Severance pay
277.

An Employee who accepts a voluntary redundancy and whose employment is terminated
under section 29 of the Public Service Act on the grounds that they are excess to the
requirement of the Agency, will be entitled to the following severance pay, subject to any
minimum amount the Employee is entitled to under the National Employment Standards:
two weeks’ salary for each completed continuous year of service, and
a pro-rata payment for completed continuous months of service since the last
completed year of service.

278.

Clause 277 is subject to the condition that the minimum amount of severance pay must be
an amount equal to four weeks’ salary and the maximum amount payable is an amount
equal to 48 weeks’ salary.

279.

Severance pay is calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period of service when the
Employee worked part-time, subject to any minimum amount the Employee is entitled to
under the National Employment Standards.

Page 40 of 53

Service for severance pay purposes
280.

Service for severance pay purposes means:
service in the Agency,
Government Service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave Act,
service with a Commonwealth body (other than service with a Joint
Commonwealth-State body corporate in which the Commonwealth does not
have a controlling interest) which is recognised for Long Service Leave
purposes,
service with the Australian Defence Force,
APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under repealed
section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922, if the service has not previously been
recognised for severance pay purposes, and
service in another organisation where an Employee was transferred from that
organisation with a transfer of function; or an Employee engaged by that
organisation on work within a function is appointed as a result of the transfer of
that function to the APS and such service is recognised for Long Service Leave
purposes.

281.

For earlier periods of service to count, there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where:
the break in service is less than one month and occurs where an offer of
employment with the new employer was made and accepted by the Employee
before ceasing employment with the preceding employer, or
the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the
Employee was deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under the
repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922.

Service not to count for severance pay purposes
282.

Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes are periods of
service that ceased by way of:
termination under section 29 of the Public Service Act,
prior to the commencement of the Public Service Act, by way of redundancy,
forfeiture of office, retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or loss of
qualifications or dismissal or termination of probationary appointment for
reasons of unsatisfactory service,
voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the
Employee, or
payment of a redundancy benefit or a similar payment or an employer-financed
retirement benefit.

Page 41 of 53

283.

Absences from duty which do not count as service for Long Service Leave purposes will
also not count for severance pay purposes.

Salary for redundancy calculations
284.

For an excess Employee, ‘salary’ includes:
the Employee’s substantive salary on the date of termination of their
employment
TPL where the Employee has received TPL for a continuous period of at least
12 months immediately preceding the date on which the Employee is offered a
voluntary redundancy, and
allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of Annual
Leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement
for expenses incurred, or a payment for disabilities associated with the
performance of duty.

Transfer with another Employee (job swap)
285.

Where an Employee does not wish to be considered for a voluntary redundancy, the
Employee may agree to transfer with another Employee from the Agency or with an
Employee from another Agency. The other Employee must not already be excess, but
wishes to be excess. Transfers with another Employee are subject to the approval of the
Chief Executive Officer and are considered on a case-by-case basis.

286.

The transfer with another Employee must be completed and in effect prior to end of the
consideration period.

Retention Period
287.

Where an Employee does not wish to be considered for a voluntary redundancy, and the
Chief Executive Officer determines that the Employee is excess, the Employee will
commence their retention period on the day after the expiry of the consideration period.

288.

The intention of the retention period is to enable an Employee who is excess to be
reassigned in the APS or to find other suitable employment. Consistent with this intention,
during the retention period:
the Agency will continue to provide reasonable career transition assistance and
take reasonable steps to move the Employee to a suitable vacancy in the
Agency or to another agency or to pursue placements outside the APS, and
the Employee will take reasonable steps to secure permanent re-assignment or
placement.

289.

The retention period is:
13 months where an Employee has 20 or more years of continuous, current
service with the APS or is over 45 years of age, or
seven months for all other Employees.

Page 42 of 53

290.

However, the retention period applying under clause 289 is reduced by an amount
equivalent to an Employee’s redundancy entitlement under the National Employment
Standards calculated as at the end of the adjusted period.

291.

Where the Chief Executive Officer determines there is insufficient work available to an
Employee during the retention period, the Chief Executive Officer may, with the agreement
of the Employee, terminate their employment under section 29 of the Public Service Act.
The Employee will be paid the balance of the retention period as a lump sum.

Reassignment of duties and reduction in classification
292.

The following will apply during the retention period:
the Employee will have access to up to $1,200 for payment for outplacement
services or training opportunities that would be expected to enhance their
employment prospects. The Chief Executive Officer may also approve additional
outplacement assistance (up to the value of $3,000) during the retention period
for Employees over 45 years of age and Employees in regional remote areas
the Employee will be considered for advertised vacancies to which the
Employee seeks a transfer first and in isolation from, and not in competition
with, other applicants who are not excess, but only at or below the Employee’s
classification. In placing the Employee, consideration will be given to the
Employee’s current skills and experience or the Employee’s ability to acquire
the relevant skills for the advertised vacancy in a short period of time
Suitable trial placements in another organisation including private sector
organisations, may be funded for up to three months where there is an
identifiable opportunity for permanent placement and no transfer arrangement
with another Employee is involved. An Employee may undertake more than one
trial placement, and
reasonable assistance in meeting reasonable travel costs and incidental
expenses incurred in seeking alternative employment, on request.

293.

If a suitable vacancy does not exist at the same classification in the Agency, or where the
Chief Executive Officer proposes to reduce the Employee’s classification as a means of
securing alternative employment, the Employee will be given four weeks' notice before the
reduction in classification occurs.

294.

If a reduction in classification occurs after the consideration period and before the end of the
retention period, the Employee will receive payments to maintain the Employee’s salary for
the balance of the retention period, after which the Employee’s salary will be paid at the
highest pay point at the reduced classification.

Extension of the retention period
295.

The retention period will only be extended by certified leave for personal illness or injury,
mandatory Maternity Leave or where the Chief Executive Officer is satisfied that an
Employee is substantially incapacitated and unfit for work. The retention period will not be
extended for any other absences except where the Chief Executive Officer is satisfied that
special circumstances exist.

Page 43 of 53

296.

In any circumstances, the retention period will not be extended beyond an additional eight
weeks.

Involuntary Redundancy
297.

If an Employee is unsuccessful in obtaining permanent reassignment of duties at the end of
the retention period, their employment will be terminated under section 29 of the Public
Service Act on the ground of excess to the requirements of the Agency.

298.

Where an Employee’s employment is to be terminated, the Employee will be given four
weeks' notice of termination of employment, or five weeks for an Employee over 45 years of
age with at least five years of continuous APS service. The notice of termination of
employment period will be served, as far as reasonably practicable, concurrently with the
retention period.

299.

In deciding whether to terminate the employment of an Employee, the Chief Executive
Officer will take account of any reassignment process that may be in progress.

300.

An Employee may consent to involuntary termination during the retention period. Severance
pay is not available to Employees who resign or consent to involuntary redundancy during
the retention period.

301.

Where an Employee elects to have their employment terminated before the expiration of the
notice of termination period, payment in lieu for any unserved portion of the notice of
termination period will be made to the Employee.

PART I - DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Introductory clauses
302.

If a dispute relates to a matter arising under this Agreement or the National Employee
Standards, this Part sets out procedures to settle that dispute.

303.

An Employee who is a party to a dispute may appoint a representative for the purposes of
the procedures.

304.

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures:
an Employee must continue to perform their work as they would normally unless
they have a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety;
and
an Employee must comply with a direction given by the Agency to perform other
available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
i.

the work is not safe, or

ii.

applicable work health and safety legislation would not permit the work to
be performed, or

iii.

the work is not appropriate for the Employee to perform, or

iv.

there are other reasonable grounds for the Employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.

Internal dispute resolution
305.

In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must attempt to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level, by discussions between the Employee or Employees and relevant
manager.

External dispute resolution
306.

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may
refer the matter to the Fair Work Commission.

307.

The Fair Work Commission may deal with the dispute in two stages:
the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers
appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or
making a recommendation; and
if the Fair Work Commission is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage,
the Fair Work Commission may then:
i.

arbitrate the dispute; and

ii.

make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Page 45 of 53

Note: If the Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are available to it
under the Fair Work Act. A decision that the Fair Work Commission makes when arbitrating a dispute is a
decision for the purpose of Div 3 of Part 5.1 of the Fair Work Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made
against the decision.

308.

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair Work
Commission in accordance with this term.
