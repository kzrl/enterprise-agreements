DISPUTE RESOLUTION
21

If a dispute relates to a matter arising under this Agreement, or the NES, in the first
instance the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the workplace
level by discussions between the employee or employees concerned and relevant
supervisors and/or management.

22

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute a party to the dispute
may refer the matter to the Fair Work Commission. The Fair Work Commission may
deal with the dispute in 2 stages:
a)

the Fair Work Commission will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers
appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making

make a determination that is binding on the parties.
Note: If the Fair Work Commission arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are
available to it under the Act. A decision that the Fair Work Commission makes when arbitrating a
dispute is a decision for the purpose of Div 3 of Part 5.1 of the Fair Work Act. Therefore, an appeal
may be made against the decision.

an employee must comply with a direction given by the Secretary to perform other
available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
(i)

the work is not safe; or

(ii)

applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the
work to be performed; or

(iii)

the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or

(iv)

there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.

The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by the Fair Work

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

PART C

REMUNERATION

SALARY
26

Salary rates and classification structures for DVA employment groups during the life of
this Agreement are set out at Attachment A.

Pay increases
27

The following increases will apply to DVA salary rates:
a)

2% on and from the date of operation of this Agreement; and

b)

2% on and from the 12 month anniversary of the increase in clause 27 (a); and

c)

2% on and from the 12 month anniversary of the increase in clause 27 (b).

Salary on engagement, promotion or transfer
28

On either engagement, reassignment of duties from another APS agency,
advancement or promotion, an employee's salary will normally be payable at the
minimum of the salary range of the relevant classification unless the Secretary
determines otherwise.

29

The Secretary may authorise payment of salary on engagement, reassignment of
duties or promotion at one of the higher salary points within the applicable salary
range for that classification as at Attachment A where the employee's experience,
qualifications and skills warrant such payment. Determination of salary is subject to the
requirements of any qualification or other prerequisites described in this Agreement.

30

On engagement, service as a non-ongoing employee may, but will not necessarily,
be taken into account in determining salary within the range.

31

On promotion, if a DVA employee has been on temporary assignment for a period
totalling 12 months within the previous 2 years at or above the non-SES classification
level to which they are promoted, the salary on promotion will be the second pay
point in the relevant classification. Additional periods of temporary assignment may
be taken into account in determining a higher pay point.

32

At the discretion of the Secretary, and taking into account the total remuneration
available to an employee under this Agreement, if an ongoing employee moving on
reassignment or promotion from another agency to DVA (including, for example,
moves between the Parliamentary Service and the APS) whose salary in their previous
agency (current salary) exceeds the salary that would otherwise apply under this
Agreement, may be maintained on their current salary until such time as their salary is
absorbed by DVA pay increases.

Casual loading
33

A non-ongoing employee engaged to perform duties of an irregular or intermittent
nature will be paid an additional 20% of their hourly rate of salary in lieu of payment
for public holidays on which the employee is not rostered to work and paid leave
(except Long Service Leave).

Salary on reduction
34

Where an ongoing employee is reassigned on an ongoing basis to duties at a lower
classification, the Secretary will determine the employee's rate of salary within the
range for that classification. Service at both the current and lower classification will be
taken into account in determining the reduced salary.

7
DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

Temporary reduction in salary
35

Where a manager and an employee agree in writing to the employee temporarily
performing work at a lower classification for a specified period of time, the Secretary
may determine an agreed rate of salary up to the maximum of the salary range
applicable to the lower APS classification for the agreed period.

Salary advancement within a work level
36

Following the yearly performance review a manager may, subject to the requirements
of this Agreement, authorise the advancement of an employee to the next highest
salary rate within the employee’s substantive and temporary assignment work level.

37

Salary advancement is subject to the employee being assessed as competent against
his/her performance agreement and any advancement pre-requisites described in
this Agreement. Where a manager considers an employee exceeds their performance
expectations during a performance cycle, the manager may undertake an additional
performance review and approve salary advancement for the employee at that time
provided the employee has performed that role for at least 6 months.

Graduates
38

On engagement as an APS Level 3 (DVA Band 2), DVA Graduate (local designation),
an employee will be required to undertake a Graduate Development Program
determined by the Secretary. During the Program salary will be determined by the
Secretary at no less than the applicable first salary point for an APS Level 3 under this
Agreement.

39

On satisfactory completion of the Graduate Development Program, the employee will
be advanced to the APS Level 4 classification, in accordance with the advancement
provisions of this Agreement, and the Secretary will determine salary at no less than
the applicable first salary point for an APS Level 4 under this Agreement.

Cadets, trainees and apprentices
40

Remuneration and benefits for an employee engaged by DVA as a cadet or under a
Cadetship program, or under a traineeship or apprenticeship scheme, will be
determined by the Secretary consistent with any APS-wide initiatives. All applicable
percentage increases to base rates of pay contained in this Agreement will apply to
such employees.

Supported wage rates
41

Employees who are affected by a disability are eligible for a supported wage in
accordance with Attachment B.

Salary packaging
42

Employees may choose to sacrifice part of their salary for a range of non-salary
benefits. Further information is contained in the relevant DVA policy.

43

Any FBT and administrative costs incurred as a result of salary packaging arrangements
shall be met by the employee as part of their salary package.

44

Where an employee is in a salary packaging arrangement, the employee’s salary for
the purposes of superannuation, redundancy, termination or any other purposes will
be determined as if the salary sacrifice arrangement had not been entered into.

8
DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

Temporary assignment
45

An employee temporarily assigned to a higher work level than the employee’s
substantive level will be paid at a classification determined by reference to the APS
Work Level Standards.

46

The employee will be paid at the minimum point of the salary range applicable to that
classification unless determined otherwise by the Secretary having regard to:
a)

the employee having obtained a particular salary through salary advancement at
the higher classification

b)

performance, including during previous periods of temporary assignment and

c)

relevant experience and/or skills.

47

There is no minimum qualifying period for payment on temporary assignment to a
classification at the APS6 level or below.

48

Payment for temporary assignment to Executive Level 1 or higher is subject to a
minimum qualifying period of more than 4 weeks.

49

An employee will receive payment at the temporary assignment rate during paid
leave and public holidays if the temporary assignment would have continued during
the leave or public holidays.

50

The Secretary will determine the remuneration and conditions of employment to apply
when a non-Senior Executive Service (SES) employee undertakes temporary
assignments at the SES level.

ALLOWANCES
51

Allowance amounts and conditions are detailed at Attachment C.

52

A reference in this section to a relevant subscription service means a subscription
service approved by the Secretary for the purposes of providing suggested rates for
various allowances.

Departmental Liaison Officer allowance
53

An employee who performs the duties of Departmental Liaison Officer (DLO) and
attends for duty at the office of the Minister for a whole day is entitled to be paid an
allowance for that day.

54

This allowance is in lieu of any overtime or flextime provisions provided under this
Agreement.

Excess fares and excess travelling time
55

An employee at APS Level 6 (or equivalent) or below who undertakes a temporary
assignment at a different location, and incurs excess fares and additional travelling
time, will be entitled to compensation for the additional fares and time in a manner
agreed with their manager.

56

A manager may approve reimbursement of excess fares and compensation for
additional travelling time for excess or potentially excess employees who are:

57

a)

relocated through reassignment of duties at level or on reduction on a trial basis or
otherwise; and

b)

at APS Level 6 or equivalent or below prior to the reduction.

Compensation under clause 56 is available for a maximum of 6 months and cannot
be made in advance. If compensation is made during a trial period that results in
permanent placement, the total period for compensation cannot exceed 6 months.
9

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

58

Payment under this clause is not available where the employee is in receipt of travel
allowance.

First aid allowance
59

An employee will be paid first aid allowance where the Secretary determines that the
employee:
a)

holds nationally recognised Statements of Attainment issued by a Registered
Training Organisation (RTO) for the nationally endorsed first aid unit/s of
competency; and

b)

has attended training on a regular basis to refresh their first aid knowledge and skills
and to confirm their competence to provide first aid. (Refresher training in CPR must
be undertaken annually and first aid qualifications must be renewed every three
years); and

c)

has first aid responsibilities in the workplace.

Fire warden allowance
60

An employee will be paid fire warden allowance where the Secretary determines that
an employee who is not receiving first aid allowance has:
a)

successfully undertaken specified fire warden training;

b)

has continuing expertise commensurate with that training; and

c)

has fire warden responsibilities in the workplace.

Motor vehicle allowance
61

Where the manager has authorised an employee to use a private car for official
purposes the employee will be paid motor vehicle allowance (MVA). Further
information is provided in the relevant DVA policies and instructions.

62

MVA will be paid at the lesser of either the relevant rate per kilometre determined by
the Secretary with reference to the relevant subscription service or the cost to the
Australian Government of providing car hire.

63

Where an employee can demonstrate that use of a private vehicle for official purposes
involves greater expenses than are covered by the above, the Secretary may approve
payment of an additional allowance.

Restriction allowance
64

The Secretary may, with the agreement of an employee, include the employee on an
approved restriction roster and restrict the employee between the hours of 6.00pm
and 8.00am Monday to Friday, and on weekends and public holidays.

65

Employees on an approved restriction roster must remain contactable and at the
required degree of readiness to perform extra duty to be eligible for payment of
restriction allowance. A manager may arrange for restricted employees to be
provided with either a mobile telephone, pager and/or rental assistance on their
private telephone service.

66

Eligible employees will be paid restriction allowance of 8.5% of their hourly salary. An
employee’s salary for the purposes of calculating restriction allowance includes
payment for temporary assignment.

67

Eligible employees who have been restricted and are required to perform duty at a
place of work will be paid overtime in accordance with the Emergency Duty provisions
of this Agreement. Eligible employees who have been restricted and are required to
10

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

perform duty but not required to attend a place of work will be paid a minimum
overtime payment of one hour.
68

Employees will not be entitled to restriction allowance and overtime payment for the
same period of work.

69

Where more than one period of duty is required during a period of restriction, the
separate overtime payments cannot exceed the amount that would have been paid
had the employee remained on duty from the commencing time of duty on the first
attendance to the ceasing time of duty on the last attendance.

OVERTIME
70

Managers may require employees to work reasonable extra hours. Overtime is
payable to eligible employees for work required to be performed:
a)

on weekends, public holidays and during the two day Christmas shutdown; and

b)

unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, for employees other than OAWG
field employees:

c)

(i)

before 7.00am and after 6.00pm Monday to Friday; or

(ii)

between 5.00am and 9.00pm if the employee has worked at least 8 hours
ordinary time on that day.

71

Overtime does not count as time worked for flextime purposes. However, while
employees are not eligible for overtime payments until any flex debit they have is
eliminated, flex debits are reduced by the hours of overtime worked multiplied by the
applicable overtime rate.

72

An employee’s salary for the purposes of calculating overtime will include payment for
temporary assignment. Overtime rates are as follows:
Monday to Saturday: Time and one half

Employees are entitled to a break of at least eight consecutive hours, plus reasonable
travelling time, between the time they finish duty (which includes emergency duty
worked that is continuous with ordinary duty) and the time they are next required to
resume or continue work, without loss of pay. Where this break is not possible due to
business needs, the employee will be paid at double ordinary time rates for any period
of work until an eight-hour break occurs.

Rest relief after overtime
80

An employee who works overtime will be entitled to an eight hour break plus
reasonable travelling time before recommencing work, without incurring any loss of
pay or deduction from flextime.

81

An eligible employee who is directed to return to duty without the eight-hour break will
be paid double time (i.e. single time in addition to the normal hourly rate of salary) for
duty performed until an eight-hour break can be taken. An employee not eligible for
overtime who is not able to have an eight hour break should be granted time off in
lieu equal to the period of duty performed until an eight hour break can be taken.

Time off in lieu (TOIL) of overtime
82

Employees eligible for overtime payment have the option to receive TOIL instead of
overtime payments, calculated at the applicable overtime rate. In cases where TOIL
has been granted but operational requirements have prevented the employee from
taking time off within 4 weeks or other agreed period, payment of overtime will then
be made.

15

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

114

Where employer contributions are to an accumulation superannuation fund the
employer contribution will be 15.4% of the fortnightly superannuation contribution
salary. This will not be reduced by any other contributions made through salary
sacrifice arrangements. This clause does not apply where a superannuation fund
cannot accept employer superannuation contributions (e.g. unable to accept
contributions for people aged over 75).

115

Employer superannuation contributions will not be paid on behalf of employees during
periods of unpaid leave that do not count as service, (with the exception of maternity
leave without pay, parental leave without pay and adoption/fostering leave without
pay) unless otherwise required under legislation or fund requirements.

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

PART D

WORKING ARRANGEMENTS

HOURS OF DUTY
Recording attendance
118

Employees will each day record their actual time of arrival and departure and any
breaks. Further information is provided in the relevant DVA policy.

Standard ordinary hours of duty
119

From the date of operation of this Agreement the standard ordinary hours of duty for
full-time DVA employees, other than OAWG field employees, are 7 hours 30 minutes
per day, 37.5 hours per week Monday to Friday to be worked between 8.30am and
12.30pm and 1.30pm and 5.00pm.

120

OAWG field employees will work a standard day of 7 hours and 54 minutes per day
between 5.00am and 9.00pm in order to achieve a rostered day off (RDO) every
month. OAWG field employees may bank up to a maximum of 4 RDOs. Approved
morning and afternoon tea breaks will not count towards the standard hours per day.

121

For part-time employees, standard ordinary hours of duty are those in their part-time
work agreement.

Span of hours
122

The span of hours between which employees may work their normal pattern of working
hours under clause 127 is:
a)

for employees other than OAWG field employees - 7.00am to 7.00pm Monday to
Friday;

b)

for OAWG field employees - 5.00am to 9.00pm Monday to Friday.

123

It is expected that these spans will meet most of DVA’s operational needs.

124

However, where there is an identified business need, some DVA work groups may
establish working patterns beyond these spans to meet customer service requirements.

125

An employee may request and be granted approval by their manager to work an
alternative span of hours or outside their normal span for personal reasons. In
considering such requests the main consideration will be operational requirements.
Hours worked on this basis will be treated as ordinary hours and will not attract overtime
rates.

126

DVA may recruit employees with prescribed hours of duty to meet specific business
needs.

Working patterns
127

The normal pattern of hours that an employee may work between the approved span
is subject to agreement of the employee’s manager who will first consider operational
requirements and then the needs of the employee and other employees in the work
area, and any other relevant matter.

128

All employees should have a break of at least 30 minutes after working 5 consecutive
hours.

129

Employees eligible for overtime payments must not work for more than 10 hours
ordinary time a day or 5 consecutive hours without a meal break of at least 30 minutes.
Time spent travelling away from normal headquarters on official business does not
contribute towards the accumulation of 10 hours ordinary time for the purposes of this
17

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

clause, but is recorded as flextime if it occurs between the span of hours or an agreed
alternative span.

Flextime
130

Flextime will be available to all employees at the APS Level 6 (or equivalent)
classification or below, except OAWG field employees. Flextime is a scheme of flexible
working hours arrangements that enables variation of working hours, patterns and
arrangements, to provide maximum organisational flexibility with benefits to clients,
employees and DVA. Further information is available in the DVA Working Hours and
Flextime Policy. Under the scheme, an employee may:
a)

accumulate a flex credit where they work hours in excess of the standard day or a
flex debit where they work less than the standard working day;

b)

carry over a maximum of 38 hours flex credit or 10 hours flex debit into the next
settlement period;

c)

count travel time during official travel away from normal headquarters and
between the normal span of hours Monday to Friday, or agreed alternative span,
as hours worked in a settlement period; and

d)

access flex credit subject to agreement of their manager with agreement not being
unreasonably withheld.

Executive Levels
131

The working arrangements (including working patterns) for employees at the Executive
Level 1 and 2 classifications (or equivalent) are subject to agreement by their
manager. Executive Level employees will not be required to work additional hours for
extended periods. Managers and Executive Level employees should work together to
manage workload requirements, working hours and work/life balance.

132

Further information is available in the DVA Executive level Flexible Working Hours
Guidelines.

FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS
133

All DVA employees have the right to request flexible working arrangements. DVA will
make all reasonable attempts to accommodate such requests. Requests will only be
refused on reasonable business grounds.

Part-time work
134

An employee may, by agreement in writing with the employee’s manager, work less
than the ordinary hours of 150 hours over a four-week period for a specified period
including under a job-sharing arrangement. The employee will revert to full-time work
at the completion of this period unless otherwise agreed.

135

The manager and the employee may agree to vary the part-time work agreement,
including a reversion to full time hours, before the end of the agreement. Employees
returning from maternity, adoption, fostering or unpaid parental leave will have access
to part-time work within DVA for the period up to the child’s second birthday or, in the
case of adoption or fostering, the second anniversary of the placement of the child.
Under the NES, if an employee is the parent, or has responsibility for the care, of a child
who is of school age or younger, they may request to work part-time to assist in the
care of the child. These requests may only be refused on reasonable business grounds.

136

An employee who is engaged, promoted or agrees to reassignment at level to
perform management initiated part-time duties will need to apply for full-time
vacancies if they wish to return to full-time employment.

137

Part-time employees must work at least three hours on any agreed workday.
18

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

138

A part-time employee’s remuneration and other benefits including leave will be
calculated on a pro-rata basis, apart from those payments of an expense nature
where the employee will receive the same amount as a full-time employee.

Home based work
139

Employees may apply to the Secretary for permission to undertake home based work
(HBW). Where approved, DVA is responsible for the provision of any necessary
equipment and associated supplies such as personal computers, ergonomic
equipment, phone lines and stationary supplies. Applications will be considered on a
case by case basis against likely operational requirements. Further information is
available in the relevant DVA policy.

Lactation breaks
140

Nursing mothers will be permitted to take lactation breaks each day (the duration of
each break being approximately 30 minutes, although this can be discussed between
employees and their Managers). Further guidance is provided in the relevant DVA
policy.

Child and dependant care
141

Where employees are required by DVA to be away from home outside normal working
hours, managers may, in exceptional circumstances, reimburse some or all of the costs
of additional family care arrangements provided by appropriate care providers. These
arrangements would apply for short-term emergencies.

142

Where an employee has a timely application for leave (annual, purchased or long
service leave) refused or cancelled, DVA will reimburse child care costs of up to $113
per week for leave that coincides with gazetted school holidays or non-gazetted
school holidays confirmed in writing by the school.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
OAWG health checks
143

Due to the nature of the work performed by OAWG field employees, DVA will provide
annual health checks for these employees, including hearing and skin cancer checks.
Further guidance is provided in the OAWG OH&S Strategy as amended from time to
time.

Flu vaccinations
144

DVA will arrange provision of an influenza vaccination to interested employees
between 1 March and 31 May each calendar year at no cost to employees.

145

Employees who privately arrange and receive vaccinations between 1 March and
31 May in a calendar year will, upon provision of receipts, be reimbursed for the cost
of the influenza vaccine only.

Healthy lifestyle subsidy
146

DVA will provide a reimbursable subsidy, as detailed at Attachment C, each calendar
year to assist with meeting costs incurred in undertaking health and fitness activities
provided those costs are minor FBT exempt benefits.

147

Reimbursement is subject to the employee submitting evidence of expenditure that is
related to the employee and is not payable for that part of the cost of a program or
activity that has been reimbursed by a health insurance fund or other organisation.
19

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

Employee Assistance Program
148

DVA will provide access to confidential professional counselling via the Employee
Assistance Program to support employees and help them resolve personal or work
related issues.

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

PART E

LEAVE AND PUBLIC HOLIDAYS

150

Employees are required to seek prior approval before taking leave except where
unable to do so because of unexpected illness or injury.

151

Paid leave counts as service for all purposes. Unpaid leave does not count as service
for any purpose and reduces the accrual of paid leave except where otherwise
determined under legislation or otherwise specified in this Agreement or relevant DVA
policy.

152

Unauthorised absence reduces accrual for all leave and does not count as service for
any purpose.

153

An employee who has applied for or taken annual or long service leave may apply to
cancel or recredit leave where they produce documentary evidence entitling them
to other leave such as personal/carer’s leave under clause 164 a) or c),
compassionate/bereavement leave, and community service leave. When other
leave is granted, an equivalent amount of annual and/or long service leave will be recredited.

154

Further guidance on leave is provided in the relevant DVA policy.

ANNUAL LEAVE
155

Employees will accrue 4 weeks (150 hours) of paid annual leave), pro-rated for parttime employees, for each full year of service in DVA. Annual leave accrues
progressively.

156

The taking of annual leave is subject to the availability of credits and approval by the
manager, in advance. The manager may grant annual leave at either full or half pay.
Half pay annual leave will be deducted from leave credits at half the full pay rate.
Part day absences will not be granted on half pay. Employees are encouraged to
record part-day absences as flex leave or Time Off In Lieu rather than annual leave.

Cashout
157

158

A manager and employee may agree in writing, on each occasion, for the employee
to cash out up to 2 weeks of their annual leave provided the employee:
a)

has taken at least three weeks of annual leave or long service leave at full pay or
six weeks at half pay in the preceding 12 month period; and

b)

would have an annual leave balance of at least four weeks after the cashout; and

c)

has not cashed out any annual leave in the preceding 12 month period.

Payment will be at the actual rate of salary on the date of cashout, including
allowances payable during annual leave, and will be subject to usual taxation rates.

Excess annual leave
159

If an employee exceeds the maximum annual leave balance of 10 weeks at
1 October in any year (or 30 November if agreed with the manager) the employee will
be directed to take that excess leave until the employee no longer exceeds the
maximum.

160

Further information is provided in the relevant DVA policy.

Purchased leave
161

Employees may elect to purchase up to 4 weeks additional leave over a 12 month or
18 month period or up to 6 weeks additional leave over an 18 month period.

21
DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

PERSONAL/CARER’S LEAVE
162

Employees will accrue 18 days of paid personal/carer’s leave, pro-rated for part-time
employees, for each full year of service in DVA. Personal/carer’s leave accrues
progressively, and accumulates without limit.

163

Taking of personal/carer’s leave is subject to approval by the manager and granting
of paid personal/carer’s leave is subject to availability of credits. Employees must
advise their manager as soon as practicable of their absence or their intention to be
absent.

164

A manager may grant personal/carer’s leave in the following circumstances:
a)

in cases of personal illness or injury;

b)

to enable employees to attend health care appointments unless it would be
detrimental to an employee in any respect when compared to the NES under the
FW Act;

c)

to enable employees to care for a member of their immediate family or household
because of:

d)

(i)

illness or injury of the member or

(ii)

unexpected emergency affecting the member, including up to 1 week to
allow employees to put longer term care arrangements in place for the
member; and

other emergency reasons considered appropriate unless it would be detrimental to
an employee in any respect when compared to the NES under the FW Act.

165

The manager will grant an employee personal/carer’s leave if a medical practitioner
reports that the employee has had contact with a person suffering from a notifiable
disease and is unable to attend work.

166

An employee cannot use paid personal/carer’s leave while on paid maternity,
adoption or fostering leave. Personal/carer’s leave may be granted for personal illness
or injury during unpaid maternity, adoption or fostering leave, where satisfactory
medical evidence is provided.

167

Where paid personal/carer’s leave has been exhausted, a manager may grant
unpaid personal/carer’s leave for personal illness or injury subject to provision of
documentary evidence for the entire period.

168

Where paid personal/carer’s leave has been exhausted, or where there is no
entitlement to paid personal/carer’s leave, an employee is entitled to up to 2 days
unpaid personal/carer’s leave on each occasion when a member of the employee’s
immediate family or household requires care or support because of personal illness or
injury or unexpected emergency. This can be taken as 2 unbroken days or as separate
periods if agreed with the manager. Leave must be supported by documentary
evidence. Such leave does not count as service unless provided for by legislation.

Requirement for documentary evidence
169

The maximum leave for personal illness or injury that may be granted without
documentary evidence, as defined in this Agreement, is 3 continuous days per
occasion 7 days per calendar year. Other suitable supporting evidence may be
accepted for situations other than illness or injury.

170

In certain circumstances, a manager may waive the requirement for documentary
evidence for absences in excess of the maximum without documentation in a
calendar year. Further guidance is provided in the relevant DVA policy.

171

A manager may require documentary evidence for periods of less than 3 days where
there is a reasonable doubt that the absence is consistent with an appropriate use of
personal/carer’s leave. If this is requested, the employee will be required to provide
documentary evidence supporting the need for absence.
22

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

172

Where the manager has required an employee to provide suitable evidence to
support absences from the workplace, and that evidence cannot be provided to
support absences, the manager may deem the leave to be an unauthorised absence.

Invalidity
173

An employee whose employment with the APS is terminated on the grounds of
invalidity, and is subsequently re-appointed under Section 75 of the Superannuation
Act 1976, is entitled to be credited with the personal/carer’s leave balance accrued
at the date of termination.

COMPASSIONATE / BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
174

Subject to providing appropriate documentary evidence, an employee is entitled to
three days compassionate/bereavement leave:
a)

to spend time with a person in their immediate family or household who has a
personal injury, or illness, which poses a serious threat to his or her life; or

b)

after the death of a member of the employee’s immediate family or household.

175

This entitlement is available on each occasion that the above requirements are met.

176

Compassionate/bereavement leave is paid leave for full or part-time employees and
unpaid for casual employees.

177

The three days compassionate/bereavement leave may be taken as a single
unbroken period of three days or three separate one day periods or any separate
periods to which the employee and the manager agree.

178

An employee’s manager may waive the above requirement for documentary
evidence where they are satisfied that the circumstances are such that it would be
unreasonable for the employee to provide such documentation.

CAREER INTERVAL LEAVE
179

Career Interval Leave provides ongoing employees with access to a self-funded
extended absence from the workplace by allowing them to authorise DVA to allocate
20% of their annual salary, for four years, to their Career Interval Leave fund.

180

Following the completion of the four-year period the employee will be granted one
year’s leave of absence, not to count as service, and will receive payments drawn
from their career interval leave fund during that absence.

MISCELLANEOUS LEAVE
181

The Secretary may grant paid or unpaid miscellaneous leave for a variety of purposes.
Further information is contained in the relevant DVA policy.

182

Paid leave cannot be accessed during approved unpaid miscellaneous leave unless
provided for by legislation.

COMMUNITY SERVICE LEAVE
183

An employee will be granted Community Service Leave for the following purposes:
a)

participation in a voluntary emergency management activity including for regular
training, responses, reasonable travel and recovery time and ceremonial duties. Up
to 5 days paid leave per occasion may be granted. Leave in excess of 5 days per
occasion will be unpaid unless otherwise determined by the Secretary;

b)

jury service (including attendance for jury selection). An employee will continue to
be paid by DVA for any period of jury service, but will be required to pay to DVA
any amount of jury service pay excluding expense-related pay, received by the

23

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

c)

other community service activity as prescribed under the FW Act. Such leave will
be unpaid.

DEFENCE RESERVISTS LEAVE
184

fulfil Australian Defence Force (ADF) Reserve and Continuous Full- Time Service (CFTS)
or Cadet Force obligations.

185

An employee is entitled to ADF Reserve leave with pay, for up to four weeks during
each financial year for the purpose of fulfilling service in the ADF Reserve. These
purposes include training and operational duty as required and the following
provisions apply:
a)

during the employee’s first year of ADF Reserve service, a further two weeks paid
leave may be granted to facilitate participation in additional ADF Reserve training
including induction requirements.

b)

with the exception of the additional two weeks in the first year of service, leave can
be accumulated and taken over a period of two years to enable the employee to
undertake training as a member of the ADF Reserves.

c)

employees are not required to pay their tax free ADF Reserve salary to DVA in any
circumstance.

186

An employee who is an officer or instructor of cadets in a Cadet Force may be granted
paid leave of up to three weeks each financial year to perform duties as an officer or
instructor of Cadets. For these purposes ‘Cadet Force’ means the Australian Navy,
Army or Air Force Cadets.

187

Defence Reserve Leave counts as service for all purposes, except for unpaid leave to
undertake CFTS. Unpaid leave for the purpose of CFTS counts as service for all
purposes except accrual of annual leave.

188

Eligible employees may also apply for annual leave, long service leave, leave without
pay, top-up pay or they may use flextime or makeup time for the purpose of fulfilling
ADF Reserve, CFTS or Cadet Force obligations. The Secretary may also grant additional
miscellaneous leave, with or without pay, for defence force requirements, including
deployment.

189

All miscellaneous leave granted for Defence Reserve purposes counts as service for all
purposes.

190

Where an employee is deployed and receives payment for that deployment DVA will
pay the difference between:
a)

any payment received in relation to that deployment; and

b)

the salary they would have received had they been on duty in DVA for that period.

DEFENCE SERVICE SICK LEAVE
191

The Secretary will grant Defence Service Sick Leave to employees who are unfit for
duty because of an accepted injury or disease.

192

An accepted injury or disease means:

193

a)

a war-caused or defence-caused injury or disease that has been accepted under
the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986; or

b)

a service injury or service disease that has been accepted under the Military
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004; or

c)

a defence-related injury or defence-related disease that has been accepted
under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act
1988.

An employee who is or becomes eligible for Defence Service Sick Leave is entitled to:
24

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

a)

b)
194

a one-off special credit of nine weeks Defence Service Sick Leave from the latter
of:
(i)

the date of their commencement in the Australian Public Service (APS); or

(ii)

the date on which liability for their injury or disease is accepted under the
relevant Act of Parliament; and

each year thereafter, and subject to clause 194, an annual credit of three weeks
Defence Service Sick Leave.

An eligible employee can accrue Defence Service Sick Leave up to a maximum
annual credit balance of nine weeks.
Example: An employee commences employment with the DVA (first employment in
the APS) and has an accepted service injury under the Military Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act 2004. The employee received the special credit of nine weeks
Defence Service Sick Leave upon their commencement with DVA. If in year 1, the
employee used no Defence Service Sick Leave, on the first anniversary, they would
receive 3 weeks annual credit of Defence Service Sick Leave. If in years 2 and 3 the
same employee again used no Defence Service Sick Leave, they would receive two
further periods of 3 weeks annual credit and will have reached their maximum annual
credit balance of 9 weeks. This would take the employee to 18 weeks in total when
the special credit is combined with the maximum annual credit balance.

195

An eligible employee must use all of their special credit before their annual credit.

196

Where an employee's Defence Service Sick Leave credits have been exhausted,
personal leave provisions will apply.

197

Approval of Defence Service Sick Leave is subject to:
a)

the provision of a medical certificate stating the nature of the medical condition;
and

b)

internal DVA verification that the medical condition constitutes an accepted injury
or disease.

198

Defence Service Sick Leave counts as service for all purposes.

199

Leave that counts as service for personal/carers’ leave purposes will count as service
for the accrual of Defence Service Sick Leave.

LONG SERVICE LEAVE
200

Long service leave is provided in accordance with the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 and will only be granted in minimum periods of
7 consecutive calendar days at full pay or 14 days at half pay.

201

Periods of long service leave cannot be broken with other periods of leave except as
otherwise provided for by legislation.

MATERNITY, MATERNAL, ADOPTION/FOSTERING, PARENTAL LEAVE
202

An eligible employee may elect in advance to spread payment for all of their paid
maternity leave and maternal leave or adoption/fostering leave entitlement (up to 15
weeks) over a period of up to 30 weeks at a rate of no less than half normal salary.
Only the first 15 weeks of the leave will count as service.

Maternity and maternal leave
203

Eligible pregnant employees have entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave in
accordance with the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 (the
ML Act). This Agreement provides pregnant employees with an additional three weeks
of paid maternal leave to be taken continuous with any entitlement to paid maternity
leave provided by the ML Act.
25

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

ADOPTION/FOSTERING LEAVE
204

The Secretary will grant, upon application, unpaid adoption/fostering leave of up to
52 weeks to employees immediately following the placement of a child with the
employee for adoption or fostering, including court appointed permanent caring
responsibilities.

205

The first 15 weeks adoption/fostering leave will be with pay provided that immediately
prior to the date or expected date of placement of the child the employee has, or will
have, completed at least 12 months qualifying service as defined in the ML Act and
be the primary carer to the child. Where an employee completes the qualifying 12
months service within the 15 weeks immediately after placement of a child, the
remainder of that 15 week period will be with pay.

206

Unpaid adoption/ fostering leave does not count as service except for the period that
occurs between the commencement of leave and the employee qualifying for paid
adoption/fostering leave.

207

Where both adoptive/foster parents are DVA employees, the maximum amount of
adoption/foster leave that can be granted between the two employees is 15 weeks
with full pay (or 30 weeks half pay) and 52 weeks in total.

208

To be eligible for Adoption/Fostering Leave:
a)

the employee must have, or will have, responsibility for the care of the child;

b)

the leave must commence on the date of placement of the child and cease no
later than 12 months from the date of placement of the child;

c)

the child to be placed must be under the age of 16 as at the date of placement;

d)

the child must not have lived continuously with the employee for a period of 6
months or more as at the date of placement, or the expected date of placement,
and is not a child or step child of the employee or the employee’s spouse or partner;
and

e)

the employee must submit with their application for leave documentary evidence
of either the approval for adoption or the permanent fostering arrangement by a
person or organisation with statutory responsibility for the placement of the child
and, in the case of fostering, that the child is not expected to return to their family.

209

Where a fostered child is subsequently adopted by the employee, and the employee
has been granted paid leave for fostering of that child, the employee is not eligible for
additional leave under the adoption leave provisions of this Agreement.

210

Placement in relation to the adoption or fostering of a child means the day the
employee takes custody of the child or the day the employee starts travel that is
reasonably necessary to take custody of the child.

Supporting Partner Leave
211

During the 12 month period following the birth, adoption or fostering of a child an
employee whose partner has given birth or is the primary care-giver for an adopted or
fostered child may access up to two weeks paid leave for parenting purposes.

Parental leave
212

An employee who has applied for or taken 12 months paid and/or unpaid maternity,
fostering or adoption leave may also request up to an additional 12 months of unpaid
parental leave to occur immediately following the end of their first 12 months’ leave
and ending on the second anniversary of the birth or placement of the child. Requests
will only be refused on reasonable business grounds and written reasons for refusal will
be provided to the employee. Paid leave granted during the 12 month additional
parental leave period does not extend this 12 month period.
26

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

DOMESTIC AND FAMILY VIOLENCE
213

The department is committed to supporting employees affected by family and
domestic violence. The department will take a flexible and supportive approach to
assisting affected employees, as appropriate, in the individual circumstances.
Employees are encouraged to discuss which avenues of support are available to them
with their manager or with People Services.

214

Leave is available to employees who are affected by family and domestic violence.
Employees can apply for either paid or unpaid miscellaneous leave or
personal/carer’s leave to cover absences for the purpose of, but not limited to:


illness or injury resulting from family and domestic violence;



providing care or support to a family or household member who is ill or injured as a
result of family and domestic violence;

Employment Standards.

216

Managers are to keep all information concerning the leave application strictly
confidential. This includes, after sighting any supporting documentation, returning that
documentation to the employee.

217

Access to flexible working arrangements as per clause 133 may also be granted.

218

Further information is available in the department’s domestic and family violence
policy.

PUBLIC HOLIDAYS
219

220

Employees are entitled to the following public holidays:
a)

New Year's Day (1 January);

b)

Australia Day (26 January);

c)

Good Friday;

d)

Easter Monday;

e)

Anzac Day 25 April;

f)

The Queen's birthday holiday (on the day on which it is celebrated in a State or
Territory or a region of a State or Territory);

g)

Christmas Day (25 December);

h)

Boxing Day (26 December);

i)

Any other day, or part-day, declared or prescribed by or under a law of a State or
Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a region of the
State or Territory, as a public holiday, other than a day or part-day, or a kind of day
or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work Regulations from counting as a public
holiday.
If under a law of a State or Territory, a day or part day is substituted for one of the public
holidays in clause 219, then the substituted day or part day is the public holiday.
27

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

221

The Secretary and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day or part day
that would otherwise be a public holiday, having regard to operational requirements.

222

Where substitution is made for a holiday falling on a Saturday or Sunday, no public
holiday rates will be paid for duty performed on the Saturday or Sunday.

223

Where an employee cannot work on a day for which a substituted holiday has been
granted, that employee will work additional hours equivalent to their normal hours on
that missed day, at times to be agreed with the Secretary, without entitlement to
overtime payment.

224

Where an employee works on both Christmas Day and a substitute holiday, one of the
days will attract payment at the public holiday rate and the other day will be paid at
the non-holiday Saturday or Sunday rate as appropriate.

225

An employee, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in the place
where the employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid for the day or
part day absence as if that day or part day was not a public holiday, except where
that person would not normally have worked on that day.

226

Where a public holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on a
prevailing type of leave (such as leave without pay, long service leave, maternity
leave etc.) there is no entitlement to receive payment as a public holiday. Payment
for that day will be in accordance with the entitlement for that form of leave (e.g. if
on long service leave at half pay, payment is at half pay). Note that, in accordance
with the NES, an employee is not taken to be on annual leave or personal/carer's leave
on a public holiday. Where an employee is in receipt of reduced pay (e.g. long service
leave half pay and leave without pay) on both sides of a public holiday, payment for
the public holiday will be at the higher rate of reduced pay.

227

If under a law of a State or Territory every Sunday is declared or prescribed by or under
that law to be a public holiday, there is no entitlement to receive payment as a public
holiday if the employee would have worked, or does perform work, on that day. In
these circumstances, payment will only be made at the public holiday rate of pay if
employee performs work on that day, and the Sunday would otherwise be a public
holiday under clause 219 a) to h).

228

If under a law of a State or Territory Easter Tuesday is declared or prescribed by or
under that law to be a public holiday, there is no entitlement to receive payment as a
public holiday if the employee would have worked, or does perform work, on that day.

ADDITIONAL HOLIDAY
229

230

An additional holiday within the Christmas/New Year period will be determined
according to the following table:
Christmas Day

28
DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

CHRISTMAS SHUTDOWN
231

DVA work places will remain closed between Christmas and New Year. Employees will
be provided with paid time off for the working days between Christmas and New Year
with no deduction from leave credits.

232

Where employees are directed to work on one or both of these days, they will be paid
overtime in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as if these days were
public holidays.

233

Part-time employees who would not usually work on one or both of these days will be
granted time off in lieu equal to 20% of their weekly part-time hours for each of these
2 days on which they would not usually work.

234

Casual employees will not be paid for days on which they are not normally rostered to
work.

PORTABILITY OF LEAVE
235

Where an employee moves to DVA from another agency through either promotion or
reassignment of duties under the Public Service Act, or is engaged as an ongoing or
non-ongoing APS employee following a period of ongoing employment in the
Parliamentary Service or the ACT Government Service, the employee’s unused
accrued annual leave and personal/carers leave (however described) will be
recognised by DVA provided there is no break in continuity of service. This includes
recognition of full-time days on a day for day basis, regardless of the length of the day.

RECOGNITION OF PRIOR SERVICE FOR PERSONAL/CARER’S LEAVE
236

On engagement as an APS employee in DVA, periods of prior employment as either
an ongoing or non-ongoing APS employee with DVA or as a member of the Australian
Defence Force will be recognised by DVA as service for personal/carer’s leave,
provided any break in recognised continuous service does not exceed 2 months.

237

For each year of recognised prior service under clause 236, personal/carer’s leave will
accrue at the rate of 3 weeks, less any personal/carer’s leave taken. A deduction of
1 week per year of recognised service will be made when records of leave taken are
unavailable.

EXPENSES – CANCELLATION OF LEAVE OR RECALL TO DUTY
238

The Secretary may approve reimbursement of incidental and travel expenses
reasonably incurred by an employee whose leave is cancelled without reasonable
notice or who is recalled to duty.

UNAUTHORISED ABSENCE
239

An employee absent from duty without approval will have all pay and allowances
provided under this Agreement ceased until he or she resumes duty and/or is granted
leave. Such absences will not count as service for any purpose including accrual of
leave.

IMPROVING SKILLS AND PERFORMANCE

PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK
240

The department is committed to a performance management system that operates
transparently and consistently, supports employees, provides regular objective
feedback and focuses on learning and development opportunities.

241

All employees will participate in the department’s performance management
framework.

242

The purpose of the performance management process is to:

243

244

a)

develop a culture of high performance in the department;

b)

align individual performance requirements with business requirements;

c)

ensure that employees have a clear understanding of their role, and the
performance standards expected of them; and

d)

identify and plan for learning and development needs.

The principles of the performance management process are:
a)

Joint responsibility – employees and supervisors will participate in all aspects of the
performance management process, including initiating reviews, and seeking and
providing feedback as required.

b)

No surprises – the performance process will ensure that employees are aware of
their performance progress. Managers should identify and address performance
concerns at the earliest opportunity.

c)

Fair – the performance process will provide employees with an opportunity to
respond to performance feedback, consistent with natural justice principles.

d)

Holistic – work outcomes and performance measures will be realistic, within the
employee’s control and consistent with their work level.

The performance assessment process will be used to determine a performance rating
as displayed in the following table:

MANAGING UNDERPERFORMANCE
246

Underperformance or poor performance is a failure to perform the duties of the
position or to perform them to the standard required. Underperformance is usually
managed in two stages, an informal process and a formal process.

247

Where, despite workplace counselling designed to improve performance through
feedback and other measures, an employee’s performance continues to fall below
30

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

the expected standard, a two month period of formal performance counselling and
assessment will commence which will involve:
a)

a formal written warning specifying:
(i)

the required standard of duties the employee has been assigned;

(ii)

that performance will need to improve;

(iii)

how the employee’s performance will be assessed; and

(iv)

the possible consequences if the employee has not attained and sustained
the required standards by the end of the 2 month assessment period;

b)

further assessment of performance; and

c)

a final assessment at the end of the two month period.

248

If, at the end of the two month assessment period the employee’s performance fails
to meet the expected standard, the employee may have their employment
terminated or alternatively may have their classification reduced or be reassigned.

249

These provisions do not apply to non-ongoing employees or employees while they are
on a period of probation.

250

Further information is provided in the Managing Underperformance policy.

LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT
251

Subject to operational requirements and available resources, employees should have
access to at least 5 days of structured development activities per year consistent with
the 70-20-10 principle that adult learning takes place on the job (70%), through
relationships with other people (20%) and through formal situations such as courses or
workshops (10 %).

Professional registration reimbursement – APS Levels 1-5
252

Where an APS Level 1 to APS Level 5 employee is required by DVA to maintain
registration with a professional body as a prerequisite to performing their role, the
employee will be entitled to receive reimbursement of:
a)

the cost of this registration; and/or

b)

costs of items specifically related to improving or maintaining their professional skills,
qualifications or registration, such as professional membership fees, professional
development expenses or journals (as agreed in an employee’s Learning and
Development plan) up to the amount specified in Attachment C to this Agreement.
Where the actual registration costs exceed this amount, the employee may seek
approval for reimbursement of a higher amount. Reimbursement is subject to the
employee providing suitable documentary evidence of the expense incurred.

Medical Officers - Professional development
253

Medical Officers may claim up to the amount specified in Attachment C to this
Agreement for expenditure on activities to assist in attaining and maintaining relevant
and agreed skills and knowledge. Medical Officers may also be approved to engage
in private practice.

254

Further details are contained in Medical Officers – Professional Development Policy.

STUDY ASSISTANCE
255

The Secretary may approve access, for ongoing employees, to financial assistance
and/or study leave, to support the successful completion of tertiary studies that are
relevant to the operational needs of DVA. Further information is available in the Study
Assistance Policy. Specific proposals for studies assistance must be reflected in the
employee’s performance agreement.

PART G

BROADBANDS AND ADVANCEMENT

256

DVA has two broadbands, DVA Band 1 (APS Level 1 to APS Level 2) and DVA Band 2
(APS Level 3 to APS Level 5). Movement of an ongoing DVA employee between one
work level and a higher level within the same broadband, through the following
provisions, is an advancement.

257

Only ongoing DVA employees whose substantive level is below the higher work level
but within the broadband are eligible for advancement.

258

Advancement of eligible employees from one work level within a broadband to a
higher work level within the same broadband is subject to:

259

a)

the availability of sufficient ongoing work at the higher work level; and

b)

where there is more than one eligible applicant for an internally advertised
advancement opportunity, a competitive assessment of those applicants against
the skills, knowledge and personal attributes required for the available work at the
higher work level; and

c)

where there is only one eligible applicant for an internally advertised advancement
opportunity, that employee has been assessed as performing their current duties at
a standard that meets or exceeds expectations and having the skill requirements
for the available work at the higher work level.

Further details are provided in the relevant DVA policy.

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

PART H

REDEPLOYMENT, REDUNDANCY AND RESIGNATION

REDEPLOYMENT AND REDUNDANCY
260

These provisions do not apply to employees on probation or to non-ongoing
employees.

261

The Secretary will advise any employee, in writing, if he or she is likely to become excess
and will take reasonable action to assess the redeployment prospects of the
potentially excess employee.

262

Discussions will be held with the potentially excess employee to consider:
a)

redeployment opportunities for the employee concerned, taking into account the
Secretary's assessment; and

b)

whether the potentially excess employee is interested in voluntary redundancy.

263

During these discussions, the employee may choose to be accompanied by a support
person.

264

Prior to the conclusion of these discussions, employees who are not potentially excess
may be invited by the Secretary to express interest in voluntary redundancy, where
those redundancies would facilitate the redeployment of excess or potentially excess
employees.

265

Excess and potentially excess employees will be considered in isolation for all DVA
vacancies at their substantive level, and prior to those vacancies being advertised.
Excess employees will be considered before potentially excess employees. Where
more than one excess or potentially excess employee is considered for a vacancy, the
selection decision will be based on a comparative assessment of those employees.

266

Potentially excess and excess employees being assessed for redeployment to a
vacancy need only demonstrate that they will be able to satisfactorily perform the
duties, with training and development, within a reasonable time frame (ordinarily
within 3 to 6 months).

Determining excess status
267

268

An employee may be declared excess if:
a)

there is a greater number of employees at the employee’s regular level than is
necessary for the efficient and economical working of DVA; or

b)

their services cannot be effectively used because of technological or other
changes in work methods, or other organisational changes in DVA; or

c)

the employee is not willing to move to or perform duties at another locality where
their usual duties are reassigned, and the Secretary determines that these provisions
will apply to that employee.

The Secretary may advise the employee in writing that they are excess to
requirements:
a)

after the completion of discussions in clause 262 or

b)

if the employee or the employee’s representative decline to attend discussions –
no less than 4 weeks after the Secretary has told the employee that the employee
is likely to become an excess employee in accordance with clause 261.

Employee support and career transition
269

DVA will provide integrated employee support and career transition services including
financial and/or career counselling usually to a combined maximum of $850 (unless
exceptional circumstances warrant an additional amount) to assist potentially excess
and excess employees make decisions on retirement and associated issues such as
33

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

superannuation. Access to this amount is available once only. A potentially excess
employee cannot receive funding for this purpose at a later date as an excess
employee if they have already accessed this support.

Voluntary redundancy
270

Where the Secretary invites an excess employee to consider an offer of voluntary
redundancy, the employee will have 4 weeks within which to accept the offer. If the
employee accepts the offer the Secretary will issue a Notice of Termination at or after
the end of that period and not before, unless the Secretary and the employee agree
to the Notice of Termination being given earlier.

271

Only one formal offer of voluntary redundancy will be made to an excess employee.

272

Where an employee has not already received the following information, within the 4
week consideration period the employee must be given information on the
employee’s:
a)

estimated redundancy pay, pay in lieu of notice, annual and long service leave
credits;

b)

accumulated superannuation contributions and superannuation options;

c)

taxation rules applying to the various payments; and

d)

financial/career counselling reimbursement up to a combined maximum of $850
unless exceptional circumstances warrant an additional amount, and if not already
accessed previously in this process.

Redundancy benefit
273

An employee who accepts an offer of voluntary redundancy and whose employment
is terminated under section 29 of the Public Service Act on the grounds that he/she is
excess to requirements is entitled to be paid:
a)

a sum equal to 2 weeks’ salary for each continuous completed year of service
deemed to be continuous and as defined in clause 276 of this Agreement

b)

plus a pro-rata payment for completed months of service since the last completed
year of service,

subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to under the NES.
274

The minimum sum payable is 4 weeks’ salary and the maximum is 48 weeks’ salary.

275

The redundancy benefit is calculated on a pro-rata basis for any period where the
employee has worked part-time hours during their period of service and has less than
24 years full-time service subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled to
under the NES.

276

Subject to the following clauses, service for redundancy pay purposes means:
a)

service in DVA;

b)

Government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, excepting ACT Government Service (unless
transitional eligibility applies);

c)

service with the Australian Government (other than service with a Joint
Commonwealth-State body corporate in which the Australian Government does
not have a controlling interest) that is recognised for long service leave purposes;

d)

service with the Australian Defence Forces;

e)

continuous APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation under
repealed section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922, if the service has not been
previously recognised for redundancy pay purposes; and

f)

service in another organisation where:

34
DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

277

278

the employee was reassigned from the APS to that organisation with a
transfer of function; or

(ii)

the employee engaged by that organisation on work within a function is
engaged as a result of the reassignment of that function to the APS and
such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.

For earlier periods of service to count there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where:
a)

the break in service is less than 1 month and occurs where an offer of employment
with the new employer was made and accepted by the employee before ceasing
employment with the preceding employer; or

b)

the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee
was deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under repealed section
49 of the Public Service Act.

Service for redundancy pay purposes does not include any period of prior service that
ceased:
a)

279

(i)

through termination on the following grounds:
(i)

the employee lacks, or has lost, an essential qualification for performing their
duties;

(ii)

non-performance, or unsatisfactory performance of duties;

(iii)

inability to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity;

(iv)

failure to satisfactorily complete an entry level training course;

(v)

failure to meet a condition imposed under section 22(6) of the Public Service
Act; or

with the payment of a redundancy (severance) benefit or similar payment or an
employer-financed retirement benefit (e.g. superannuation).

Absences from duty that do not count as service for long service leave purposes will
not count as service for redundancy pay purposes.

Rate of payment - redundancy benefit
280

For the purpose of calculating any payment under clause 273 of this Agreement, salary
will include:
a)

the employee’s salary; or

b)

the salary of the higher work level, where the employee has been performing work
at a higher level for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately
preceding the date on which he or she is given a Notice of Termination; and

c)

other allowances in the nature of salary that are paid during periods of annual
leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances that are a reimbursement for
expenses incurred or a payment for disabilities associated with the performance of
duty.

Involuntary redundancy
Retention period
281

The Secretary will not involuntarily terminate the employment of an excess employee
under section 29 of the Public Service Act 1999, unless they otherwise agree, until the
following retention periods have elapsed:
35

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

a)

13 months service where, on the day the retention period commences, the
employee identified as excess has at least 20 years of service with the
Commonwealth, or is aged 45 years or over; or

b)

7 months service if the employee identified as excess has less than 20 years of
service with the Commonwealth, and is under 45 years of age on the day the
retention period commences.

282

If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, the retention
period at clause 281 will be reduced by that redundancy pay entitlement on
termination, calculated as at the expiry of the retention period as adjusted by this
clause.

283

The retention period will commence on the earlier of the following:
a)

the day the employee is advised in writing by the Secretary that he or she is an
excess employee; or

b)

4 weeks after the day on which the Secretary invites the employee to elect to have
their employment voluntarily terminated under clause 270 of this Agreement.

284

During the retention period the Secretary will continue to take reasonable steps to find
alternative employment for the employee, including movements at level. The
employee will also take reasonable steps to find alternative employment and actively
participate in learning and development activities, trial placements or other
arrangements agreed to, to assist in obtaining a permanent placement.

285

After taking the above steps, the Secretary may, after giving 4 weeks’ notice to the
employee, reduce their classification as a means of securing alternative employment.

286

If this occurs prior to the end of the retention period the employee will continue to be
paid at their previous salary level for the balance of the retention period. For these
purposes previous salary level includes the salary of a higher work level, where the
employee has been performing work at a higher level for a continuous period of at
least 12 months immediately preceding the date on which he or she was reduced in
classification level, provided the employee would have continued to act but for the
excess employee situation. Their previous level will also include allowances or loadings
in the nature of salary that are paid during periods of leave and on a regular basis.

287

The retention or notice periods relating to the reduction in classification of an excess
employee or notice of involuntary termination will be extended by any periods of
certificated personal/carer’s leave due to the illness of the employee during these
periods.

288

The excess employee may be provided with assistance in meeting reasonable travel
and incidental expenses incurred in seeking alternative employment where these
expenses are not met by the prospective employer.

289

Where the Secretary believes there is insufficient productive work available for an
excess employee during the retention period, the Secretary may, with the agreement
of the employee, terminate their employment under section 29 of the Public Service
Act and pay a lump sum comprising:

290

a)

the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the NES under sub-clause 282)
and this payment will be taken to include the payment in lieu of notice of
termination of employment, plus

b)

the employee’s NES entitlement to redundancy pay.

An excess employee will not have their employment terminated involuntarily:
a)

before they have been invited to consider an offer of voluntary termination of
employment, or

b)

if they have agreed to have their employment voluntarily terminated but the
Secretary refuses to approve it; and/or
36

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

c)

if there is another employee performing similar work at the same level and in the
same location who has previously agreed to have their employment terminated,
been refused, still wishes to accept voluntary termination of employment and the
Secretary agrees.

Notice periods
291

Where an employee’s employment is terminated due to voluntary or involuntary
redundancy, the employee will receive 4 weeks’ notice of termination (or 5 weeks for
employees over 45 years of age with at least 5 years of continuous service as defined
in clause 276).

292

In the case of involuntary redundancy, wherever possible the notice period will be
concurrent with the retention period.

293

Where an employee has their employment terminated before the expiration of the
notice period, payment in lieu for the unexpired period will be made. The payment
must not be less than the amount the employee would have received if they had
continued to work in accordance with their usual arrangements until the end of the
notice period.

RESIGNATION
294

Ongoing employees may resign their employment, or non-ongoing employees may
terminate their employment contract before the end of the period of engagement,
by giving the Secretary at least 14 days’ notice.

295

At the instigation of the Secretary the resignation may take effect at an earlier date
within the notice period. In such cases the employee will be paid compensation in lieu
of the notice period that is not worked.

296

Where an employee resigns on a public holiday, they will be deemed to have resigned
on the last working day prior to the public holiday.

Notes
1.
On commencement of this Agreement, these grandfathered transitional salary rates apply only to an employee
who:
(a) immediately before the commencement of the DVA Enterprise Agreement 2015-2018, held a DVA
designation listed above in Column B and the corresponding APS classification and salary rate, and remains in
that role and at that substantive level and at a corresponding salary rate; or
(b) immediately prior to the commencement of the DVA Enterprise Agreement 2015-2018, was on a period of
continuous temporary assignment at one of the above DVA designations and corresponding salary rates that has
continued without break after the commencement of this Agreement; or
(c) immediately following a period of continuous temporary assignment referred to in (b) is promoted to that job.
2.
Employees to whom these transitional salary rates continue to apply under Note 1 may progress to the next
higher salary point within the above designation in accordance with the salary advancement provisions of this
Agreement.
3.
Where an employee receiving a grandfathered transitional salary is reassigned, at the employee’s initiative, on
an ongoing basis to a role for which a transitional salary is not applicable, the employee will cease to be entitled
to the grandfathered transitional salary and will be entitled to remuneration at the appropriate salary for the new
role as reflected in Table 1 of Attachment A.
4.
Where an employee receiving a grandfathered transitional salary is temporarily reassigned and the salary of the
temporary assignment is less than the employee’s substantive salary, the employee will continue to receive, at a
minimum, their substantive salary.
#
Employees on this salary point on commencement of the Agreement, or who progress to this point during the life
of the Agreement, will translate to that identical salary point for their APS classification in Table 1 and these
transitional rates will no longer apply.
*
An employee may not progress beyond this point within the Legal 1 band unless the duties allocated to
the employee are classified at Executive Level 1 and the employee has performed duties at that level
for a minimum period of 3 months.

40
DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

ATTACHMENT B – SUPPORTED WAGE SYSTEM
1

Employees who are affected by a disability are eligible for a supported wage.
Eligibility

2

Eligible employees are those who are unable to perform the range of duties to the
competence level required within the classification for which the employee is
engaged, because of the effects of a disability on their productive capacity and
who meet the impairment criteria for receipt of a disability support pension.

3

This provision does not apply to any existing employee who has a claim against
DVA which is subject to the provisions of workers compensation legislation or any
provision of this Agreement relating to the rehabilitation of employees who are
injured in the course of their employment.
Supported wage rates

4

Employees to whom this provision applies shall be paid the applicable percentage
of the relevant base salary as outlined at Attachment A according to Table 1,
provided that the minimum amount payable is not less than the minimum weekly
amount as prescribed by the Fair Work Commission from time to time.

Where an employee’s assessed capacity is 10 per cent the employee must receive
a high degree of assistance and support.
Assessment of capacity

6

For the purposes of establishing the percentage of the relevant base salary, the
productive capacity of the employee will be assessed by an approved assessor,
having consulted the employer and the employee, and if the employee so desires,
a representative of the employee’s choosing.

7

Assessment made under this schedule must be documented in a Supported Wage
System (SWS) wage assessment agreement, and retained by the employer as a
time and wages record as required by the relevant legislation.
Lodgement of SWS wage assessment agreement

8

All SWS wage assessment agreements under the conditions of this schedule,
including the appropriate percentage of the relevant minimum wage to be paid
to the employee, must be lodged by DVA with the Fair Work Commission.

9

All SWS wage assessment agreements must be agreed and signed by the
employee and employer parties to the assessment. Where a union which has an
interest in the award is not a party to the assessment, the assessment will be referred
by the Fair Work Commission to the union by certified mail and the agreement will
take effect unless an objection is notified to the Fair Work Commission within 10
working days.
41

DVA Enterprise Agreement 2019-2022

Review of assessment
10

The assessment of the applicable percentage should be subject to annual review
or more frequent review on the basis of a reasonable request for such a review. The
process of review must be in accordance with the procedures for assessing
capacity under the SWS.
Other terms and conditions of employment

11

Where an assessment has been made, the applicable percentage will apply to the
relevant wage rate only. Employees covered by a SWS wage assessment
agreement will be entitled to the same terms and conditions of employment as all
other employees covered by this Agreement paid on a pro rata basis.
Workplace adjustment

12

An employer wishing to employ a person under the provisions of this schedule must
take reasonable steps to make changes in the workplace to enhance the
employee’s capacity to do the job. Changes may involve re-design of job duties,
working time arrangements and work organisation in consultation with other
workers in the area.
Trial period

13

In order for an adequate assessment of the employee’s capacity to be made, DVA
may employ a person covered by the SWS provisions for a trial period not
exceeding 12 weeks, except that in some cases additional work adjustment time
(not exceeding four weeks) may be needed.

14

During that trial period the assessment of capacity will be undertaken and the
percentage of the relevant minimum wage for a continuing employment
relationship will be determined.

15

The minimum amount payable to the employee during the trial period must be no
less than the minimum weekly amount as prescribed by the Fair Work Commission
from time to time.

16

Work trials should include induction or training as appropriate to the job being
trialled.

17

Where DVA and the employee wish to establish a continuing employment
relationship following the completion of the trial period, a further contract of
employment will be entered into in accordance with disability employment
affirmative measures based on the outcome of assessment under paragraphs 6
and 7 of this Attachment.
