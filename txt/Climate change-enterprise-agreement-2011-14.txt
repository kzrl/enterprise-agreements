Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

PART A - TECHNICAL AND GENERAL MATTERS
1. Title
1.1.

This Agreement is called the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE)
Enterprise Agreement 2011–2014.

2. Objective
2.1.

This Agreement aims to facilitate achievement of Departmental priorities and objectives by
ensuring the attraction and retention of staff through the provision of competitive terms and
conditions and an ongoing commitment to employee development.

2.2.

This agreement will support the continuation of honest and open consultation with staff and
their nominated representatives.

3. Parties and coverage
3.1.

This Agreement is made under section 172 of the Fair Work Act 2009. It applies to and binds
the Secretary of DCCEE (on behalf of the Commonwealth) and DCCEE employees employed
under the Public Service Act 1999, the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) and the
Media Entertainment Arts Alliance (MEAA), if Fair Work Australia notes in its decision to
approve the Agreement that the Agreement covers these unions.

3.2.

This Agreement does not cover the employment terms and conditions of:
o
o

3.3.

substantive DCCEE Senior Executive Service (SES) staff; or
persons whose salary is paid by another government agency or employer.

This Agreement replaces any employment conditions provided for in any common law
contracts or determinations under section 24 (1) of the Public Service Act 1999 that were in
place immediately before the Commencement Date. This does not affect any obligations or
responsibilities that are a part of any employee's employment contract.

4. Delegations
4.1.

The Secretary may delegate to or authorise a person to perform any of the Secretary’s
powers or functions under this Agreement.

4.2.

The term ‘Secretary’, as used in this agreement, refers to ‘Secretary or delegate’ unless
specified otherwise.

5. Operation of the agreement
5.1.

This Agreement will commence seven days after approval by Fair Work Australia and
nominally expires on 30 June 2014.

5.2.

From the commencement of this Agreement, a person or organisation covered by the
Agreement will not pursue further claims for terms and conditions of employment that
1

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
would have effect during the period of operation of this Agreement, except where
consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
5.3.

Various employment provisions contained within this Agreement are administered in
conjunction with DCCEE guidelines. DCCEE guidelines do not form part of this Agreement
and if there is any conflict, the Agreement prevails over guidelines.

6. Consultation on major changes
6.1.

Where a decision is made to introduce major changes in program, organisation, structure,
technology or polices that are likely to have significant effects on employees, the Secretary
must notify the employees who are likely to be affected by the proposed changes and their
representatives, if any.

6.2.

Significant effects may include:
o
o
o
o
o
o
o

termination of employment;
major changes in the composition, operation or size of the Agency’s workforce or in
the skills required;
the elimination or reduction of job opportunities, promotion opportunities or job
tenure;
significant alteration in hours of work;
the need to retrain employees;
the need to relocate employees to another workplace; and
the major restructuring of jobs.

6.3.

The Secretary must discuss with the affected employees and their representatives, if any,
the introduction of the changes referred to in clause 6.1, the effects the changes are likely to
have on employees and measures to avert or mitigate the adverse effects of such changes
on employees and must give prompt consideration to matters raised by the employees
and/or their representatives in relation to the changes.

6.4.

The discussions must commence as early as practicable after a definite decision has been
made to make the changes referred to in clause 6.1.

6.5.

For the purposes of such discussion, the employees concerned and their representatives, if
any, are to be provided in writing all relevant information about the changes including the
nature of the changes proposed, the expected effects of the changes on employees and any
other matters likely to affect employees. The Secretary is not required to disclose
confidential or commercially sensitive information to the employees.

7. General staff consultation
7.1. The Department commits to consultation with the parties covered by this Agreement as a
basis for the Agreement’s effective implementation. For the purpose of this agreement,
consultation means providing affected employees and, where they choose, their
representatives with timely access to relevant information and genuine opportunity to
2

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
respond to the decision maker and contribute to the decision making processes before the
decision is made.
7.2.

DCCEE is committed to consulting with employees. The key mechanisms used within the
Department for consultation are:
o
o
o

7.3.

Staff Consultative Committee;
regular meetings with employees at the Group, Divisional, Branch and team level as
required; and
direct discussions with staff.

The composition of the Staff Consultative Committee, associated support and access to
facilities will be in accordance with the relevant Terms of Reference. As a minimum the Staff
Consultative Committee (SCC) will comprise:
o
o
o
o

the Chair, nominated by the Secretary;
one management representatives;
one employee representative from each organisational unit (currently referred to as
a Division); and
one representative from each of the CPSU and MEAA.

7.4.

To facilitate open and transparent consultation, outcomes from SCC’s considerations on
proposed policies will be provided to all staff along with explanation as to the final decision.

7.5.

The role of union and other workplace delegates will be respected and facilitated in
accordance with the principles outlined in Australian Public Service Bargaining Framework.

8. Employee representatives
8.1.

The parties recognise that employees are free to choose to join or not to join a union.
Irrespective of that choice, employees will not be disadvantaged or discriminated against in
respect of their employment under this Agreement. Employees who choose to be members
of a union have the right to have their industrial interests represented by that union and to
participate in lawful union activities, subject to the terms of this Agreement and relevant
industrial legislation.

8.2.

The role of workplace delegates is to be respected and will be facilitated in accordance with
the provisions outlined in Attachment C – Rights of workplace delegates and elected union
representatives.

8.3.

Workplace delegates must act in good faith.

9. Dispute resolution
9.1.

If a dispute relates to:
o
o

a matter arising under the agreement; or
the National Employment Standards;
3

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
this term sets out procedures to settle the dispute.
9.2.

An employee who is a party to the dispute may appoint a representative for the purposes of
the procedures in this term.

9.3.

In the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to resolve the dispute at the
workplace level, by discussions between the employee or employees and relevant
supervisors and/or management.

9.4.

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute may
refer the matter to Fair Work Australia.

9.5.

Fair Work Australia may deal with the dispute in 2 stages:
o

o

Fair Work Australia will first attempt to resolve the dispute as it considers
appropriate, including by mediation, conciliation, expressing an opinion or making a
recommendation; and
if Fair Work Australia is unable to resolve the dispute at the first stage, Fair Work
Australia may then:
 arbitrate the dispute; and
 make a determination that is binding on the parties.

Note: If Fair Work Australia arbitrates the dispute, it may also use the powers that are
available to it under the Act.
9.6.

A decision that Fair Work Australia makes when arbitrating a dispute is a decision for the
purpose of Division 3 of Part 5.1 of the Act. Therefore, an appeal may be made against the
decision.

9.7.

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this term:
o

o

an employee must continue to perform his or her work as he or she would normally
unless he or she has a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his or her
health or safety; and
an employee must comply with a direction given by the employer to perform other
available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless:
 the work is not safe; or
 applicable occupational health and safety legislation would not permit the
work to be performed; or
 the work is not appropriate for the employee to perform; or
 there are other reasonable grounds for the employee to refuse to comply
with the direction.

9.8. The parties to the dispute agree to be bound by a decision made by Fair Work Australia.

4

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

10.Individual flexibility arrangement
10.1.

The Secretary and an employee covered by this enterprise agreement may agree to make an
individual flexibility arrangement to vary the effect of terms of the agreement if:
o

o
o

10.2.

The Secretary must ensure that the terms of the individual flexibility arrangement:
o
o
o

10.3.

the arrangement deals with one or more of the following matters:
 arrangements about when work is performed;
 overtime rates;
 penalty rates;
 allowances;
 remuneration; and/or
 leave; and
the arrangement meets the genuine needs of the Department and employee in
relation to one or more of the matters mentioned in paragraph (a); and
the arrangement is genuinely agreed to by the Secretary and employee.

are about permitted matters under section 172 of the Fair Work Act 2009; and
are not unlawful terms under section 194 of the Fair Work Act 2009; and
result in the employee being better off overall than the employee would be if no
arrangement was made.

The Secretary must ensure that the individual flexibility arrangement:
o
o
o
o

o

is in writing; and
includes the name of the employer and employee; and
is signed by the Secretary and employee and if the employee is under 18 years of
age, signed by a parent or guardian of the employee; and
includes details of:
 the terms of the enterprise agreement that will be varied by the
arrangement; and
 how the arrangement will vary the effect of the terms; and
 how the employee will be better off overall in relation to the terms and
conditions of his or her employment as a result of the arrangement; and
states the day on which the arrangement commences and, where applicable, when
the arrangement ceases.

10.4.

The Secretary must give the employee a copy of the individual flexibility arrangement within
14 days after it is agreed to.

10.5.

The Secretary or employee may terminate the individual flexibility arrangement:
o
o

by giving no more than 28 days written notice to the other party to the
arrangement; or
if the Secretary and employee agree in writing — at any time.

5

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

PART B - OUR WORKPLACE
11. Workplace culture
11.1.

DCCEE is committed to maintaining a diverse workforce and a workplace that is free from
discrimination and harassment.

11.2.

In DCCEE, our commitment to workplace diversity ensures that we value and respect our
differences and that our workplace is fair, accessible, flexible and inclusive and free from
discrimination, bullying and harassment. By drawing on a wide range of points of view, we
can work to our full potential in achieving DCCEE’s business goals.

11.3.

During the life of this agreement the Department will implement strategies in support of the
Government objectives to increase workplace participation rates of indigenous persons,
people with a disability and other minority groups.

12. Health and wellbeing
12.1.

DCCEE will provide a program of health activities for employees. Employees are encouraged
to participate in the activities which are promoted.

12.2.

DCCEE will ensure a confidential, professional counselling service is available to help
employees resolve personal or work related problems. Details will be made available to
employees on the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).

13. Support for carers
13.1.

DCCEE will reimburse reasonable, unavoidable, additional costs associated with the care of a
family member or dependent where an employee is required to travel away from his or her
normal work location for business purposes or is directed to work outside his or her normal
pattern of hours. The employee must advise his or her supervisor in advance that costs may
be incurred. This provision may also cover costs associated with alternative care for pet
accommodations incurred as a direct consequence of travel or official duties.

14. Learning and development
14.1.

DCCEE recognises the importance of a comprehensive development strategy for all
employees and managers that:
o
o
o

o

14.2.

develops and supports professional and technical expertise;
supports organisational priorities,
provides a range of learning and development mechanisms consistently available to
support the development of employees to meet the priority capabilities, skills and
knowledge identified in their performance agreements; and
recognises and supports relevant studies through studies assistance.

DCCEE provides numerous capability development opportunities for employees including:

6

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
o
o
o
o

on the job learning opportunities including special projects, taskforces and
secondments;
core skill training such as writing skills, Microsoft office suite, project management;
strategic skill sets including policy and legislative processes, developing business
cases; and
leadership skills.

14.3.

As part of the Department’s commitment to capability development, employees are
encouraged to undertake relevant study.

14.4.

Employees undertaking formal study, which is relevant to business requirements, may be
eligible for reimbursement of course fees up to the cost of the course and/or study leave of
up 75 hours per semester or agreed period of study which includes reasonable travelling
time. Further details on the type of study assistance available are in the Study Assistance
Policy.

14.5.

Identified development needs should be recorded in the employee’s performance
development agreement and be reviewed on a regular basis in line with the Performance
Development Framework.

15. Performance management
15.1.

The Department understands the importance of measuring and recognising performance.

15.2.

The parties agree that an effective system of performance management is integral to the
operations of the Department. DCCEE will develop and maintain an effective Performance
Development Framework that will provide mechanisms for:
o
o
o
o
o

effective, two-way feedback between employees and their managers;
identifying development needs and career opportunities;
determining substantive level;
rewarding good work performance; and
managing underperformance.

15.3.

The Performance Development Plan is a living document underpinned by Performance
Development Framework (PDF) and is intended to provide structured support for, rather
than to replace, the day-to-day provision of guidance, recognition and exchange of feedback
in DCCEE’s workplace.

15.4.

Upon commencement of this agreement a five-point scale will be used when discussing and
assessing the outcome of performance and development at the End of Cycle Assessment
discussions. The five point scale is ‘unsatisfactory’, ‘developing to standard’, ‘fully effective’,
‘superior’, and ‘outstanding’.

15.5.

The underlying principles of the PDF will be based on natural justice and constant feedback
aimed at ensuring there are “no surprises” in relation to performance matters.
7

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
15.6.

Salary advancement will be available to ongoing employees consistent with the provisions of
this Agreement (refer to section 56) provided the employee has not already reached the
highest pay point for their classification.

15.7.

All employees are required to participate in the PDF unless they are a non-ongoing employee
engaged for a period of less than 13 weeks.

15.8.

Non-ongoing employees will not be eligible for an increment increase unless they have been
employed continuously in the Department for 12 months or more and have been in the
same role for six (6) months or more.

16. Managing underperformance
16.1.

The Department is committed to clearly defining work performance standards through the
PDF. Employees are to receive regular and specific feedback on their performance and are to
be provided with appropriate support from managers in meeting expected performance
standards.

16.2.

The guidelines for management of underperformance will not apply to:
o
o
o

16.3.

employees during a period of probation;
non-ongoing employees; or
employees being case managed due to identified medical condition/injury or loss of
essential qualifications.

Where underperformance is identified, the Department will work with affected employees
and their managers to attain and sustain the standards required. The following steps should
be taken to address the underperformance:
o

o

The underperformance should be promptly discussed with the employee and an
improvement plan developed. Identified strategies should be clearly defined and an
agreed timeframe for improvement be specified. This timeframe should be no less
than four weeks.
Where there is no improvement the manager will provide the employee, and more
senior manager, with written advice of the need for the employee’s performance to
improve. During a six week assessment period, the manager will assess the
employee’s performance and prepare a progress report, at a minimum, on a weekly
basis.

16.4.

In line with natural justice principles the employee must be given the opportunity to
comment on all reports produced through the underperformance process.

16.5.

If the employee’s performance remains unsatisfactory possible actions include reduction in
classification, reassignment of duties or termination of employment.

16.6.

If the employee has met the expected standard of performance at the end of the six week
assessment period, no further action will be taken.
8

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

PART C - EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS
17. Flexible working arrangements
17.1.

Managers and employees have a responsibility to ensure that the flexible working conditions
contained in this Agreement are both administered and accessed in such a way as to ensure
that:
o
o
o

working patterns are fair and encourage a balance between work and private lives
for all employees;
assessment of, and reward for, an employee’s performance is based primarily on
their output, not hours at work; and
these conditions are applied fairly and consistently across the Department.

17.2.

It is the role of managers to recognise that employees need to balance work and private lives
and therefore managers will ensure that their employees are able to access employment
terms and conditions (including the utilisation of flextime credits, access to time off in lieu
(TOIL), part-time work and payment for overtime), where eligible. It is the responsibility of
individual employees to consult their managers in accessing these terms and conditions and
to be aware that operational requirements may limit access to some conditions at certain
times.

17.3.

An employee who is a parent, or has responsibility for the care of a child under school age or
a child under 18 who has a disability, may request flexible working arrangements, including
part-time hours. The employee is not eligible to make this request unless they have
completed at least 12 months of continuous Commonwealth service (the Secretary may
waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances).

17.4.

Employees with responsibilities other than caring for a child may, consistent with clause
17.2, may apply to access flexible working arrangements in order to manage these needs.

17.5.

A casual employee engaged for irregular or intermittent duties may only request flexible
work arrangements if the employee:
o
o

17.6.

is a long term (12mths) casual employee immediately before making the request;
and
has reasonable expectation of continuing employment on a regular and systematic
basis.

A request made in accordance with clauses 17.3 and 17.4 must be in writing and set out
details of the change sought and the reasons for the change. The Secretary will respond in
writing to the request within 21 days. Approval will be granted unless the flexible work
arrangements do not meet reasonable operational requirements of DCCEE. Where the
request is refused, the response will specify the reasons for the refusal in sufficient detail as
to provide the individual with the opportunity to respond.
9

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

17.7.

The individual may refer the matter to Assistant Secretary Human Resources in the first
instance to have the matter reviewed. The Assistant Secretary Human Resources will make a
recommendation to the Secretary and advise the employee of the outcome. This does not
preclude the individual from accessing any other form of dispute resolution if the matter is
still unresolved after the review.

18. Hours of work
18.1.

The Department recognises that employees have responsibilities outside the workplace that
may limit their ability to adjust their normal working patterns in response to workload
pressures. Managers will accommodate those responsibilities wherever possible and will
consult with an employee if there is a need for the employee to work beyond their normal
hours of work. Employees undertake to meet reasonable demands asked of them by their
managers in times of workload pressures.

18.2.

Ordinary hours of work for full-time employees are 37.5 hours per week (standard day -7
hours and 30 minutes). Standard attendance hours are from 8.30am to 12.30pm and 1.30pm
to 5.00pm Monday to Friday

18.3.

The default span of hours during which an employee may work his or her ordinary hours is
7.00am to 7.00pm Monday to Friday. The span of hours may be varied to an alternative 12
hour period by agreement, in writing, between an employee and his or her Assistant
Secretary. Where an employee requests to work outside this bandwidth, e.g. on Saturday or
Sunday, he or she may do so with the agreement of his or her manager. Any hours worked
on this basis will be considered ordinary hours and not attract overtime.

18.4.

An employee’s normal hours are those hours and time, within the agreed bandwidth, that
the employee works on a regular basis. The pattern of hours by which an employee will work
his or her ordinary hours should be agreed with his or her supervisor

18.5.

An employee may be reverted to standard ordinary hours where:
o
o

if an employee’s supervisor considers that the employee’s attendance is
unsatisfactory or an employee is misusing flextime; or
an employee and his or her supervisor cannot agree on a pattern of hours.

18.6.

Where reversion to ordinary hours is being considered the manager must discuss the
proposed action with the affected employee prior to making their decision. The decision
should be in writing outlining the reasons why the employee is being reverted and the
requirements that need to be met before access to flexible arrangements is restored.

18.7.

All employees covered by this Agreement are required to record their working hours. APS 1
to 6 employees who are seeking to access flextime must record their attendance on DCCEE’s
timekeeping system. EL Staff who are seeking to access TOIL should provide evidence of
hours worked. The preferred option is for EL staff to use DCCEE’s timekeeping system.
10

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
18.8.

Employees will not normally be required to work for more than 7.50 hours on any one day
and should not work more than five (5) consecutive hours without taking a break of at least
30 minutes.

18.9.

Managers have a responsibility to minimise the extent to which employees are required to
work beyond normal working patterns, and to ensure that employees have reasonable
access to departmental resources such as remote access to assist them in achieving
appropriate work life balance.

18.10. Where employees are required to work outside the bandwidth and public transport or
alternative arrangements are not available or practicable, managers should take account of
the Department’s duty of care regarding employees’ safety and, if appropriate, provide
secure, accessible car parking or cabcharge vouchers to meet the employee’s costs of
transport.

19. Christmas close down
19.1.

DCCEE will close its normal operations from close of business on the last working day before
Christmas, with business resuming on the first working day after New Year’s Day.

19.2.

Employees will be provided with time off for the working days between Christmas and New
Year’s Day and will be paid in accordance with their ordinary hours of work. Where an
employee is absent on leave, payment for the Christmas closedown provision will be in
accordance with the entitlement for that form of leave, (e.g. if on long service leave half pay,
both sides of the close down payment for the close down is on half pay; if on leave less than
full pay on only one side of the close down then pay will be at the full time rate).

19.3.

There will be no deduction from Annual or Personal/carer’s leave credits for the closedown
days.

19.4.

Part time employees normally not working on the days of the week on which annual
closedown occur will not be entitled to alternative time off duty.

19.5.

An employee who is required to work during Christmas closedown will receive time off in
lieu.

20. Public holidays
20.1.

Employees will be entitled to the following public holidays:
o
o
o
o
o
o

New Year's Day (1 January);
Australia Day (26 January);
Good Friday;
Easter Monday;
Anzac Day (25 April);
The Queen's birthday holiday (on the day on which it is celebrated in a State or
Territory or a region of a State or Territory);
11

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
o
o
o

Christmas Day (25 December);
Boxing Day (26 December);
Any other day, or part-day, declared or prescribed by or under a law of a State or
Territory to be observed generally within the State or Territory, or a region of the
State or Territory, as a public holiday, other than a day or part-day, or a kind of day
or part-day, that is excluded by the Fair Work regulations from counting as a public
holiday.

20.2.

If under a state or territory law, a day or part day is substituted for one of the public holidays
listed above, then the substituted day or part day is the public holiday.

20.3.

The Secretary and an employee may agree on the substitution of a day or part day that
would otherwise be a public holiday, having regard to operational requirements.

20.4.

An employee, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in the place where
the employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid for the part or full day
absence as if that day or part-day was not a public holiday, except where that person would
not normally have worked on that day.

20.5.

Where a public holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on leave (other
than Annual or paid Personal/carers leave) there is no entitlement to receive payment as a
public holiday. Payment for that day would be in accordance with the entitlement for that
form of leave (e.g. if on long service leave on half pay, payment is on half pay).

20.6.

Part time employees normally not working on the days of the week on which annual
closedown occur will not be entitled to alternative time off duty.

20.7.

An employee may refuse on reasonable grounds a request to work on a public holiday.

21.Part-time employment and job sharing
21.1.

A part time employee is one who:
o
o

regularly works less than full time ordinary hours; and
has reasonably predictable hours of work.

21.2.

All part-time and job sharing work arrangements will be subject to agreement.

21.3.

The Secretary will consider applications in light of operational requirements. Where an
employee has had a formal application for part time, job sharing or work from home
arrangements rejected, the Secretary will advise the employee of the reason(s) for the
decision in writing, including reasons relating to operational requirements. The Secretary,
the employee and, where the employee requests, a support person will meet to consider
alternative arrangements if required.

12

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
21.4.

A part-time employee will revert to full-time employment at the end of the agreed period,
unless a renewal is approved. A part-time employee may revert to full-time at any time if the
Secretary agrees.

21.5.

Remuneration and other conditions will be calculated on a pro rata basis, apart from
allowances of a reimbursement nature, where a part time employee will receive the same
amount as a full time employee.

21.6.

A part time employee may not vary their hours for a period of one week or less. Changes in
hours for these periods should be accommodated using flextime or alternative
arrangements as agreed with their manager. The pattern of working hours and any
variations to the arrangements will be agreed in writing.

21.7.

Consistent with section 38, Managers will make every attempt to accommodate the part
time work requests of employees returning from parental leave, maternity leave, paternity
leave, foster care, adoption leave and pre adoption leave. Depending on operational
requirements, the employee may be given suitable duties other than those performed prior
to that leave. Reasons for non-approval must be provided in writing to the employee.

22. Home based work (HBW)
22.1.

DCCEE is committed to providing a workplace which is flexible, supportive, safe and
innovative. HBW can benefit both employees and the Department as it assists employees to
balance their work and personal commitments. HBW arrangements may also assist
employees who require adjustments to their work arrangements as a result of an illness or
disability.

22.2.

This section does not apply to arrangements for periods of one day or less and that are not
required on a regular basis. In such occasions verbal approval should be obtained prior to
working from home.

22.3.

The Secretary may agree to an ongoing or longer term non-ongoing employee working from
home. This may be on either a regular, temporary or intermittent basis. A HBW arrangement
may be initiated by either the Department or an employee. Where an employee initiates a
HBW proposal in respect of his/her own position, the Department has the right to refuse the
proposal. Similarly, where the Department proposes a HBW arrangement, the employee has
the right to refuse the proposal.

22.4.

HBW agreements should not extend for more than 12 months and should be reviewed on a
six monthly basis. The agreement review and end dates should correspond with the
performance cycle where practicable to do so. If circumstances change the HBW agreement
should be reviewed prior to the 6 month date.

22.5.

Arrangements to work at home require prior written approval by the Secretary. An email
record of the request/approval is sufficient with a copy forwarded to Human Resources.

13

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
22.6.

A security assessment of the premises may be required if classified material is to be accessed
or stored at the proposed location for home based work. Employees are expected to follow
security protocols in accordance with the Agency Security Plan.

22.7.

Where deemed necessary an Occupational Health and Safety assessment will also be
conducted and necessary office equipment identified.

22.8.

A HBW agreement should include an understanding of the level of financial support the
relevant business unit will provide in respect of required IT and/or office equipment and
telephone and/or internet access for the HBW site. Hours of work are to be clearly stated in
ad hoc and longer term agreements.

22.9.

All required office equipment and supplies will be provided by DCCEE. The employee is
expected to keep the equipment in good condition and use it appropriately for work
purposes only.

22.10. The travel time between the HBW site and a DCCEE office is not included as part of the
employee’s normal working day unless directed and approved by the Secretary.
22.11. The Secretary or the employee may terminate a HBW arrangement if they provide two
weeks’ notice, in writing, of the intention to do so. The period of a HBW agreement may be
reduced upon agreement between the Secretary and the employee. Reasons for terminating
a HBW agreement may include, but are not limited to:
o
o
o
o
o
o

changes in departmental operational requirements;
inefficiency or ineffectiveness of the HBW agreement or performance issues;
failure to comply with requirements of the HBW agreement;
change of HBW address, unless the arrangement is re-negotiated prior to the change
of address;
where reasonable access to the HBW site has been denied to management or their
representatives; or
failure to comply with security arrangements.

23. APS level employees: flextime
23.1.

Flextime is a system of flexible working hour arrangements that enables employees and
managers to vary working hours, patterns and arrangements to provide maximum
organisational flexibility with benefit to employees, clients and the Department. APS 1 to 6
employees, including part-time employees are eligible to participate and use flextime.

23.2.

DCCEE’s flextime arrangements include the following features:
o

o

when an employee works more than their standard hours they will accumulate a
flextime credit, and when an employee works less than their standard hours they
will incur a flextime debit;
flextime will be credited or debited on a one-for-one basis (i.e. one hour worked will
result in one hour of flextime credit);
14

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
o

o

an employee may reduce their flextime credit (or incur a flextime debit) by taking a
flextime absence, which is an absence from the workplace during standard working
hours requested in advance by the employee and approved by the employee’s
supervisor;
a flextime absence may be taken in part or full days up to a maximum of five (5)
consecutive days;

23.3.

APS 1-6 employees (and their equivalents) are eligible to accrue flextime for duty performed
in excess of their ordinary hours of work (over the four week settlement period), but which
does not attract overtime.

23.4.

The relevant manager may require an employee not to work hours in addition to ordinary
hours where there is insufficient work. That is, a manager may require that an employee not
accrue flextime where such accrual cannot be justified by the employee's workload.

23.5.

Employees may carry over a maximum of one week flex credit at the end of the settlement
period.

23.6.

Flex credits exceeding one week (37.5 hours for a full time employee) may be cashed out at
ordinary time rates where, due to organisational requirements, the manager cannot
envisage an opportunity for the employee to use these credits in the settlement period.

23.7.

Employees may carry over a maximum of two days (15 hours) for a full time employee) flex
debit accumulated in any settlement period into the next settlement period.

23.8.

Flex balances in accordance with 23.6 and 23.7 will be retained upon movement, either
temporary or permanent, between organisational units.

23.9.

In circumstances where the maximum debit is exceeded at the end of a settlement period,
the employee will endeavour to reduce the debit to the maximum allowable (or lower) over
the next settlement period. Should this not occur, the amount may be recovered.

23.10. Where an employee has failed to comply with the provisions of flextime, the Secretary may
remove that employee from flextime for a specified period and the employee will revert to
working the standard ordinary hours. Access to flexible working arrangements will be
restored where the Secretary is satisfied that the employee will maintain satisfactory
attendance patterns.

24. Executive Level employees: time off in lieu (TOIL) and flexible hours
24.1.

Executive Level employees have an important role in providing leadership and establishing a
positive culture in order to ensure the Department can achieve its outcomes.

24.2.

The Secretary will ensure Executive Level staff can access TOIL and that the provisions are
consistently applied across the Department. The Department does not endorse working
arrangements that require Executive Level employees to work excessive hours over
15

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
significant periods. Where situations in relation to excessive hours do arise, the manager in
consultation with the business unit’s Executive is required, with the employee, to address
the circumstances leading to excessive working hours.
24.3.

Executive Level employees and their manager are required to work together to manage
workloads and working hours. Where an Executive Level employee works in excess of
ordinary hours for sustained periods the manager and employee will agree to arrangements
for reasonable time off to recognise the additional effort.

24.4.

Executive Level employees should be provided with fair and reasonable access to time off , it
is considered good practice for this to occur as soon as practicable after the additional hours
has been worked.

24.5.

Consistent with clause 17.7 an individual may refer a matter relating to access to TOIL to the
Assistant Secretary Human Resources in the event that the provision of TOIL cannot be
addressed in good faith by all parties.

24.6.

Executive Level employees should not commence work on any day without having at least
minimum break of eight hours plus reasonable travelling time from the previous day’s duty,
without specific approval from the Secretary.

24.7.

Regardless of the bandwidth, Executive Level employees are required to break for at least 30
minutes after five (5) hours of continuous work.

25. Overtime
25.1.

APS 1-6 level employees (and their equivalents) will be provided with TOIL or payment of
overtime where they are required by their manager to perform work:
o
o
o
o

outside the bandwidth;
on a public holiday;
in excess of a standard day within the bandwidth (7 hours 30 minutes on any one
day); or
outside the hours of a part- time employee’s agreement.

25.2.

TOIL is the standard form of recompense for all overtime, subject to the provisions of this
section.

25.3.

Managers will authorise the payment of overtime in circumstances where, due to the nature
of work and/or the significant overtime performed, it is unlikely that an employee will be
able to take TOIL within three months of the overtime having been performed, or where the
employee requests payment to meet costs incurred as a result of having performed the
overtime. Where payment of overtime is authorised, the payment will be calculated using
the rates set out in clauses 25.8.

16

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
25.4.

Executive Level employees (and their equivalents) are not generally entitled to overtime.
However, in exceptional circumstances, the Secretary may approve overtime payments for
excess hours worked where considered appropriate.

25.5.

A part time employee who has not elected to receive flextime for work performed in excess
of the agreed hours of duty over the settlement period will be eligible for overtime.

25.6.

Where an employee is directed to perform overtime and is approved in advance by the
Manager, overtime will be paid.

25.7.

Time spent travelling to or from work will not count as part of an overtime attendance.

25.8.

Where overtime is worked, TOIL is calculated at the following rates:
Period
Monday to Friday
Saturday
Sunday
Public Holidays, from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm
Public Holidays, for any other hours

25.9.

Rate
Time and one half for the first three
hours and double time thereafter.
Time and one half for the first three
hours and double time thereafter.
Double time.
Time and one half (in addition to normal
salary).
Double time and one half.

In calculating the overtime entitlement, a divisor of 37.5 hours is to be used.

25.10. Where overtime is worked on a public holiday which falls on a weekday, the overtime
payment or TOIL is calculated at double time and a half for duty outside the standard day for
full time employees (i.e. a standard day is from 8:30am to 5:00pm or the agreed pattern of
hours for part-time employees). For overtime within the standard day for full time
employees or agreed pattern of hours for part-time employees, overtime payment or TOIL
will be calculated at single time and a half as employees are already being paid single time
for this period for the public holiday.
25.11. Where a period of overtime is not continuous with ordinary duty, the minimum overtime
payment is four hours at the relevant rate. Where the period of overtime is greater than four
hours, payment will be made for the actual period worked at the relevant rate.
25.12. Overtime is considered to be continuous with ordinary duty when an employee does not
have a break, other than a meal break, between the periods of ordinary duty and overtime.
25.13. Where more than one attendance is involved, the minimum overtime payment provision will
not operate to increase an employee’s overtime payment beyond that which they would
have received had they remained on duty from the commencing time of duty on one
attendance, to the ceasing time of duty on a subsequent attendance.
17

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
25.14. Where an employee is directed to work outside the bandwidth, the employee will be
entitled to an eight (8) hour break plus reasonable travelling time before commencing work
again, and the employee’s manager should direct the employee to take a break of eight (8)
hours. If the break occurs during standard working hours, then the employee will receive
their normal salary during that period.
25.15. Subclause 25.14. does not apply to an employee who is directed to work outside the
bandwidth for a period of two (2) hours or less and the period of work commences no earlier
than two (2) hours before the beginning of the bandwidth.
25.16. Where a break as described in subclause 25.14 above is not possible due to operational
requirements, the employee will be paid for subsequent periods of work at the applicable
overtime rate until the employee has taken an eight (8) hour break.
25.17. An employee cannot claim flex or TOIL and also receive an extra duty payment in respect of
the same hours.
25.18. Where employees are required to work outside the bandwidth and public transport or
alternative arrangements are not available or practicable, managers should take account of
DCCEE’s duty of care regarding employees’ safety and, if appropriate, provide secure,
accessible car parking or cabcharge vouchers to meet the employee’s costs of transport.

18

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

PART D – LEAVE
26. General conditions
26.1.

DCCEE provides access to a flexible range of options for paid and unpaid absences from work
that assists employees to balance work with other personal priorities.

26.2.

Where an employee has had a formal application for leave rejected, the Secretary will advise
the employee of the reason(s) for the decision in writing, including reasons relating to
operational requirements. The manager, the employee and, where the employee requests, a
support person will meet to consider alternative arrangements if required.

26.3.

All accrued leave entitlements will be expressed and deducted in hours and minutes.

26.4.

Where an employee is absent on compensation leave, a manager is required to consult with
the Rehabilitation Case Manager prior to approval of applications for other forms of leave.

26.5.

An employee, who is absent on a day or part-day that is a public holiday in the place where
the employee is based for work purposes, is entitled to be paid for the part or full day
absence as if that day or part-day was not a public holiday, except where that person would
not normally have worked on that day.

26.6.

Where a public holiday falls during a period when an employee is absent on leave (other
than Annual or paid Personal/carers leave) there is no entitlement to receive payment as a
public holiday. Payment for that day would be in accordance with the entitlement for that
form of leave (e.g. if on long service leave on half pay, payment is on half pay).

26.7.

The Department will not unreasonably cancel approved leave or recall employees to duty
while on leave. In such circumstances the Secretary will approve reimbursement toward
travel expenses, incidental expenses or family care costs. If an employee’s leave is cancelled
without reasonable notice the employee will be recredited with the amount of leave
cancelled. If an employee is recalled to duty the employee will be recredited with a period
equivalent to the ordinary hours worked.

26.8.

An employee who is ill or injured for one day or longer while on annual leave or long service
leave and who produces satisfactory medical certificate may apply for personal/carer’s leave
and have their annual or long service leave recredited.

27. Portability of leave
27.1.

Where an employee moves (including on promotion or for an agreed period) from another
agency where they were an ongoing APS employee, the employee’s unused accrued annual
leave and personal/carers leave (however described) will be recognised, provided there is no
break in continuity of service.

27.2.

Where an employee is engaged as either an ongoing or non-ongoing APS employee
immediately following a period of ongoing employment in the Parliamentary Service or the
19

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
ACT Government Service, the employee’s unused accrued annual leave and personal/carers
leave (however described) will be recognised.
27.3.

Where a person is engaged as an ongoing employee, and immediately prior to the
engagement the person was employed as a non-ongoing APS employee, the Secretary may,
at the employee’s request, recognise any accrued annual leave and personal/carers leave
(however described), provided there is no break in continuity of service. Any recognised
annual leave excludes any accrued leave paid out on separation.

27.4.

Use of these accrued leave credits and future entitlements is in accordance with this
Agreement.

27.5.

Prior service will be recognised for long service leave purposes in accordance with the Long
Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 if the break in service is not more than
12 months.

27.6.

Where an employee is employed after having been deemed to have resigned following
marriage under the former section 49 of the Public Service Act 1922, or is re-engaged
following invalidity retirement or termination from the APS on the grounds of invalidity, the
employee will be credited with any personal/carer’s leave credits held at the time of ceasing
the earlier period of employment.

28. Annual leave
28.1.

The purpose of annual leave is to provide employees with the opportunity for a reasonable
break from work. Therefore, it is important that employees take leave within a reasonable
period of its accrual, and that leave planning is an integral part of work planning and task
allocation for managers. The timing and duration of annual leave is to be mutually agreed
between the employee and manager unless the leave is for health and/or safety reasons.

28.2.

Employees are entitled to the equivalent of 20 days, for each full year worked. Annual leave
will accrue daily, and be credited monthly.

28.3.

The taking of annual leave is subject to the approval of the manager.

28.4.

Where ‘leave without pay not to count as service’ has been granted in the accrual period,
annual leave will be adjusted on the day of accrual as follows:
o
o

o

where aggregated absences for periods totalling 30 calendar days or less, the annual
leave accrual is not affected;
where aggregated full day absences total more than 30 calendar days, the entire
period of leave without pay is deducted from the number of calendar days to count
as service in the formula at clause 28.5; and
where leave without pay covers an entire calendar year, no annual leave credit
accrues for that year.

20

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
28.5.

Annual leave credits for all eligible employees will be calculated using the following formula:

150 = Basic annual credit of four weeks expressed in hours
28.6.

Each period of service that has different weekly hours, is calculated separately. If separate
credits are calculated, all credits are added and expressed as a total number of hours of
leave available.

28.7.

Employees may take annual leave at either full or half pay.

28.8.

Where a public holiday occurs in a period of annual leave, the public holiday will not be
deducted from the employee’s annual leave credits.

28.9.

Access to payment in lieu of unused accrued annual leave is available to employees when
their APS employment is terminated.

28.10. Payment will be calculated using the employee’s final rate of salary, including allowances
that would have been included in the employee's pay during a period of annual leave.
28.11. Without limiting the general entitlement under clause 28.2 and 28.3, an employee may
access annual leave where they have a long term illness and have exhausted other paid
leave entitlements.
28.12. An employee may cash out annual leave providing their remaining credit is not less than four
weeks (equivalent amount for part time employees). In order to cash out annual leave, the
employee will need to make an election in writing and this must be approved by the
Secretary.
28.13. Where an employee's amount of accrued annual leave is approaching 40 days, the employee
and the employee's supervisor should discuss the situation and seek to agree on a leave
management strategy to reduce the amount of accrued annual leave. Any such strategy
should take into account previous patterns of leave over the last couple of years.

29.Purchased leave
29.1.

Employees may apply to purchase up to 4 weeks (20 days) additional leave per calendar
year.

29.2.

Repayments for purchased leave will be calculated and deducted over 26 pay periods. A
shorter period for repayments may be agreed to. Purchased leave must be taken within 12
months of the purchased leave date.
21

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
29.3.

Purchased leave will count for service for all purposes. The employee’s salary for
superannuation purposes continues to be their salary as if they had not purchased leave.

30. Long service leave
30.1.

An employee is eligible for long service leave in accordance with the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976.

30.2.

The minimum period during which long service leave can be taken is seven calendar days (at
full or half pay). Long service leave cannot be broken with other periods of leave, except as
otherwise provided by legislation. Periods of long service leave cannot be broken with any
other leave including absences on flex leave (except as provided for by the Maternity Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 and the personal leave provisions of this Agreement).

30.3.

The Secretary will consider applications for long service leave in light of operational
requirements.

31. Personal/carer’s leave
31.1.

Personal/carer’s leave may be used when an employee is ill or injured and is unable to
attend for duty or required to provide care or support for members of the employee’s family
or household because of a personal illness or injury of the member or an unexpected
emergency affecting the member.

31.2.

On engagement, an ongoing employee will be credited with personal/carer’s leave of 20
days (150 hours) or the part time equivalent. Thereafter Personal/carer’s leave credits will
accrue monthly and will be credited on the anniversary of the employee’s commencement.
Existing APS employees who are transferred or promoted into DCCEE Personal/carer’s leave
credits will accrue monthly and credited on the anniversary of the employee’s
commencement (subject to clause 31.4) without limit throughout the employee's period of
employment with the Department.

31.3.

Personal/carer’s leave credits will be calculated, using the following formula:

Where:
150 = Basic annual credit of twenty days expressed in hours
31.4.

Where ‘leave without pay not to count as service’ has been granted in the accrual year,
personal/carer’s leave accrual will be deferred as follows:
o

where aggregated full day absences total 30 calendar days or less, the accrual is not
affected;
22

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
o

where aggregated full day absences total more than 30 calendar days, the entire
period of leave without pay defers accrual.

31.5.

Non-ongoing employees will be credited 4 days (30 hours), or the part time equivalent upon
commencement and each anniversary of commencement. Thereafter personal/carer’s leave
of 10.91 hours will be credited monthly, to a total credit of 20 days (150 hours) per annum or
part time equivalent.

31.6.

Personal leave will not be debited where an employee is medically unfit for duty or required
to undertake carer’s responsibilities on a public holiday which the employee would
otherwise have observed.

31.7.

If an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend work the employee or his or her
representative should make a reasonable effort to call the relevant supervisor before
9:30am.

31.8.

An employee will provide a medical certificate from registered health practitioners or, where
it is not practical to provide a medical certificate, a statutory declaration or in the case of
Carer’s leave a personal declaration or other supporting evidence acceptable to his/her
manager (on his/her manager’s request) in the following circumstances:
o
o
o

31.9.

where the employee is or will be absent on personal leave for three (3) or more
consecutive working days;
where the employee has taken more than ten days personal leave in an accrual year
and has been directed to provide evidence prior to taking additional leave;
if the manager has reason to believe that the employee’s absence is not consistent
with the appropriate use of personal leave.

where the employee is unable to perform duties at the higher classification because
of physical or mental incapacity.

If an employee requests in writing or is directed to perform work at a lower classification

PART G – ALLOWANCES
60. Temporary reassignment of duties
60.1.

Having regard to individual circumstances, the Secretary may temporarily reassign an
employee to other duties, including duties at a higher or lower classification, providing such
duties are:
o
o
o

within the limits of his or her training, skill and capability;
consistent with the Classification Rules 2000; and
not designed to promote de-skilling.

60.2.

Where an employee is temporarily reassigned duties at a lower work classification level, the
Secretary may determine in writing, with agreement in writing from the employee, that the
employee shall be paid a rate of salary applicable to the lower classification level. Such
determination will specify the period for which the lower salary will apply.

60.3.

This clause does not apply to decisions made by the Secretary in relation to breaches of the
Code of Conduct or underperformance.

60.4.

Prior to filling a temporary vacancy the Secretary will consider whether:
o
o

o
o

it is essential that the duties of the position be performed for the period of the
vacancy;
it is reasonable for other employees to share the duties of the position for the
period of the vacancy, provided the duties are within the training, skill and
competence of employees;
there are delegations or statutory powers held by the position that cannot
reasonably be exercised by another employee who holds those powers; and
the position is involved in public contact and has to be staffed to comply with client
service standards.

developmental purposes.

60.6.

Where an employee is to be paid a TROD allowance, the employee will be paid at the pay
point nominated by the Secretary, in consultation with the relevant employee, and

classification level will be at least maintained.

60.8.

TROD allowance will be payable where an employee has performed duties at a higher level
after 10 working days (inclusive of public holidays). If the period extends beyond the 10
working days (inclusive of public holidays) TROD allowance will be payable for the entire
period.

60.9.

An employee who is reassigned duties at a higher level in an SES or non SES position for a
period of five consecutive working days or more and the role requires the management of
other employees, will receive payment of TROD allowance.

60.10. Where the full duties of the position are not being undertaken by the employee, the
Secretary may agree to payment at a point in a classification below that of the higher
position.
60.11. TROD allowance does not form part of an employee’s base rate of pay and will only count for
superannuation purposes in accordance with superannuation legislation.
60.12. DCCEE recognises the importance of filling vacant positions on a permanent basis. Where an
employee has performed the duties in an ongoing vacant position for a continuous period of
12 months or more, the relevant SES Manager will endeavour to nominally fill the position as
soon as practicable.
60.13. An employee on TROD allowance who is granted paid leave or who observes a public holiday
will continue to receive TROD allowance, payable having regard to the provisions of this
section, during his or her absence. TROD allowance will not be paid beyond the date on

The sole and exhaustive rights and remedies in relation to termination of employment are
under:
o
o
o

the Act;
other Commonwealth laws (including the Constitution); and

45

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
76.2.

Payment will be made to dependants or the partner of the former employee or their legal

PART I – REDEPLOYMENT AND REDUNDANCY
77. Redeployment and Redundancy Principles
77.1.

The following redeployment, reduction and retrenchment (RRR) provisions will apply to
ongoing employees who are not on probation.

78. Notification of Potentially Excess or Excess Status
78.1.

Throughout the process the Secretary will take all reasonable steps, consistent with efficient
operational requirements, to transfer the employee if the employee is potentially excess to a
suitable vacancy at an equal classification level within the Department. As a potentially
excess employee it is the employee’s responsibility to take all reasonable steps to identify
and apply for suitable vacancies at an equal classification level.

78.2.

If redeployment has not been successful the employee will be declared excess.

78.3.

DCCEE will consider an excess employee in isolation from and not in competition with other
applicants for any advertised job in DCCEE at or below the employee’s classification level for
which the employee has applied.

78.4.

Employees seeking redeployment may be referred to a redeployment program, if
redeployment is not readily available in DCCEE. DCCEE will meet any costs associated with
this referral.

78.5.

An employee who has been referred to a redeployment program and who has not already
been made an offer of redundancy will be made an offer of redundancy two months after
the referral if the employee cannot be placed within DCCEE or the APS.

78.6.

An employee who has been advised that he or she is excess will be made only one offer of
voluntary retrenchment in respect of any single retrenchment situation.

79.1.

Where the Secretary considers there is likely to be a need to identify employees as excess,
he/she will, as soon as practicable, advise the employees of the situation in writing, and
offer to hold discussions with those employees, to consider:
o
o
o
o

actions that might be taken to reduce the likelihood of the employees becoming
excess;
redeployment opportunities for the employees within the agency or another APS
agency;
the possibility of retrenchment with the payment of a redundancy benefit; and
an employee may choose to be represented in any such discussions.
46

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

o
o

o
o

advise the employee in writing of the decision and may invite the employee to elect

80.2.

Where the Secretary invites an excess employee to elect for retrenchment with a
redundancy benefit, the employee will have three weeks in which to notify the Secretary of
his or her decision (the consideration period). Where the employee elects for retrenchment
the Secretary may decide to retrench the employee but will not give notice of termination
before the end of the consideration period without the agreement of the employee.

80.3.

The consideration period can be reduced by agreement between the employee and the
Secretary. Where the period is reduced the employee will, on termination, be paid the
unexpired period of the consideration period; and payment in lieu of the relevant period of
notice of termination provided for in clause 84.1 and 84.2.

80.4.

Only one invitation to elect for retrenchment with the payment of a redundancy benefit will
be made to an excess employee.

81. Accelerated separation
81.1.

The Secretary may provide employees likely to be subject to the redundancy provisions of
this Agreement with an accelerated separation option. In addition to the severance benefit,
this option provides employees who have been identified as eligible to be made an offer of
voluntary redundancy and whose employment is terminated by the Secretary under section
29 of the Public Service Act 1999 on the grounds that they are excess to requirements within
14 days of receiving it, an amount of 10 weeks’ salary (or 11 weeks’ salary for an employee
45 years of age with a least two years continuous service). The payments made under this
clause are inclusive of the period of consideration and any statutory entitlement to payment
in lieu of notice.

82. Redundancy Payments
82.1.

If the employee accepts an offer of redundancy and their employment is terminated by the
Secretary under s 29 of the Public Service Act 1999 on the grounds that the employee is
47

excess to requirements, the employee will be paid a sum equal to two weeks salary for each
completed year of service; plus a pro rata payment for completed months of service since
the last completed year of service, subject to any minimum amount the employee is entitled

period, the employee will receive payment in lieu of notice for the unexpired portion of the
notice period.

Redundancy payments will be calculated on:
o
o

o

84.2.

Where an employee has worked part-time hours during his or her period of service and the

relates to the part-time service will be paid on pro-rata basis as follows:
o

84.3.

the employee’s salary at the substantive work value level on the date of
termination;
the salary of the higher level work value level, where the employee has been
working at the higher level for a continuous period of at least 12 months
immediately preceding the date on which the employee is given notice of
termination; and
other allowances in the nature of salary which are paid during periods of annual
leave and on a regular basis, excluding allowances which are a reimbursement for
expenses incurred, or a payment for disabilities associated with the performance of
duty.

current annual full-time equivalent salary (used for redundancy purposes), divided
by full time hours, multiplied by the part-time hours for that part-time period
worked.

Subject to Clauses 85.4, 85.5 and 85.6 service for redundancy pay purposes means:
48

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14
o
o
o

o
o
o

84.4.

Periods of service that will not count as service for redundancy pay purposes are any periods
of service that ceased by way of:

termination under s29 of the Public Service Act 1999;
prior to the commencement of the Public Service Act 1999, by way of redundancy;
retirement on ground of invalidity; inefficiency or loss of qualifications; forfeiture of
office; dismissal or termination of probationary appointment for reasons of
unsatisfactory service;
voluntary retirement at or above the minimum retiring age applicable to the
employee; or
payment of a redundancy benefit or similar payment.

For earlier periods of service to count there must be no breaks between the periods of
service, except where:
o

o

84.6.

services in an APS agency;
government service as defined in section 10 of the Long Service Leave
(Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976;
service with the Commonwealth (other than service with a joint CommonwealthState body corporate in which the Commonwealth does not have a controlling
interest) which is recognised for long service leave purposes;
service with the Australian Defence Forces;
APS service immediately preceding deemed resignation (as defined), if the service
has not previously been recognised for severance pay purposes; and
service in another organisation where an employee was transferred from the APS to
that organisation with a transfer of function or an employee engaged by that
organisation on work within a function is appointed as a result of the transfer of that
function to the APS and such service is recognised for long service leave purposes.

the break in service is less than 4 weeks and occurs where an offer of employment
with the new employer was made and accepted by the employee before ceasing
employment with the preceding employer; or
the earlier period of service was with the APS and ceased because the employee was
deemed to have resigned from the APS on marriage under the repealed section 49
of the Public Service Act 1922.

Any period of service which ceased by way of:
o
o
o
o

any of the grounds for termination specified in s.29 of the Public Service Act 1999
(including any additional grounds prescribed in the PS Regulations);
on a ground equivalent to any of these grounds;

redundancy benefit will be entitled to the following period of retention:
o
o

7 months; or
13 months where an employee has 20 or more years of service or is over 45 years of
age.

85.3.

If an employee is entitled to a redundancy payment under the NES, the retention period at
clause 86.2 will be reduced the employee’s redundancy pay entitlement under the NES on
termination, calculated as at the expiration of the retention period (as adjusted by this
clause).

85.4.

It is the excess employee’s responsibility to take all reasonable steps to identify and apply for
suitable vacancies at their substantive level during the retention period.

locality the Agency Head may approve reasonable expenses where these expenses
are not met by the prospective employer;
may, after giving 4 weeks’ notice to the employee, reduce the employee’s
classification as a means of securing alternative employment. If this occurs prior to
the end of the retention period, the employee will continue to be paid at their
previous level for the balance of the retention period.

The retention period will not be extended by any periods of paid or unpaid leave. The
Secretary may consider extending a retention period where medical evidence indicates the
employee is substantially incapacitated and are considered to be unfit for work by a medical
practitioner nominated by the Department. It would only be in exceptional circumstances

50

Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency – Enterprise Agreement 2011-14

86. Retention period – early termination

Service Act 1999 ; and upon termination, the employee will be paid a lump sum comprising:
o

o

the balance of the retention period (as shortened for the National Employment
Standards under sub-clause 92.2) and this payment will be taken to include the
payment in lieu of notice of termination of employment, plus
the employee’s NES entitlement to redundancy pay.

87. Involuntary termination of employment at the conclusion of the retention
period
87.1.

In accordance with s.29 of the Public Service Act 1999 , the Secretary may involuntarily
terminate the employment of an excess employee at the end of the retention period.

not been invited to elect for retrenchment with the payment of a redundancy benefit or has
elected for retrenchment but the Secretary has refused to approve it.

ATTACHMENT C – RIGHTS OF WORKPLACE DELEGATES AND ELECTED
UNION REPRESENTATIVES
The role of union workplace delegates and other elected union representatives is to be respected
and facilitated. Agencies and union workplace delegates must deal with each other in good faith. In
discharging their representative roles at the workplace level, the rights of union workplace delegates
are:
o the right to be treated fairly and to perform their role as workplace delegates without any
discrimination in their employment;
o

recognition by the agency that endorsed workplace delegates speak on behalf of their
members in the workplace;

o

the right to participate in collective bargaining on behalf of those whom they represent, as
per the Fair Work Act

o

the right to reasonable paid time to provide information to and seek feedback from
employees in the workplace on workplace relations matters at the agency during normal
working hours;

o

the right to email employees in their workplace to provide information and seek feedback,
subject to individual employees exercising a right to ‘opt out’;

o

undertaking their role and having union representation on an agency’s workplace relations
consultative committee;

o

reasonable access to agency facilities (including telephone, facsimile, photocopying, internet
and email facilities, meeting rooms, lunch rooms, tea rooms and other areas where
employees meet) for the purpose of carrying out work as a delegate and consulting with
members and other interested employees and the union, subject to agency policies and
protocols;

o

the right to address new employees about union membership at the time they enter
employment;

o

the right to consultation, and access to relevant information about the workplace and the
agency; and

o

the right to reasonable paid time to represent the interests of members to the employer and
industrial tribunals.

In discharging any roles that may involve undertaking union business, the rights of union workplace
delegates are:
o reasonable paid time during normal working hours to consult with other delegates and
union officials in the workplace, and receive advice and assistance from union staff and
officials in the workplace;
o

reasonable access to appropriate training in workplace relations matters including training
provided by a union;

o

reasonable paid time off to represent union members in the agency at relevant union
forums.

In exercising their rights, workplace delegates and unions will consider operational issues,
departmental policies and guidelines and the likely affect on the efficient operation of the agency
and the provision of services by the Commonwealth.
For the avoidance of doubt, elected union representatives include APS employees elected to
represent union members in representative forums, including, for example, CPSU Section
Secretaries, Governing Councillors and Section Councillors.
